===========================================================================

Vocpack is SHAREWARE software; you are free to copy and distribute
unregistered versions of this program on condition that all files are
included without any modification. No fee must be charged for such
distribution.

The copyright displayed by the program VP.EXE contains the version number
of Vocpack: '2.0 demo' for unregistered copies and '2.0' for registered
ones. The shareware unregistered version of Vocpack 2.0 can only compress
sound files for evaluation purpose but can't decompress them. If you want a
fully functional copy you must register.

Files compressed with the unregistered version can be decompressed with the
registered one: the two programs are identical, except that in version '2.0
demo' decompression is disabled.

For a successful registration you must have the two files REGISTER.EXE and
REGISTER.DAT; if these files were modified or damaged I can't assure that
you will be able to obtain a working registered copy of Vocpack. I don't
assume any responsibility for such event, since the integrity of the
package depends on the honesty of the people who carried Vocpack to you.
I report here the CRC-32's of the two files:

     REGISTER.EXE        dc4d93df
     REGISTER.DAT        cbd275c1

In my answer to your registration request I will write again the original
CRC-32's. You can test if they correct by typing

     PKUNZIP -V VOCPAK20.ZIP

and checking if the codes in the column 'CRC-32' match the ones reported
above. If they don't, you should obtain a good copy of VOCPAK20.ZIP from
another source.

There are two possible registration options:

A) Vocpack 2.0 Standard package:
   a fully functional command-line version of Vocpack 2.0. The registered
   program is NOT shareware, it's licensed for personal use of the person
   who registered it and can't be copied to anyone else.
   
   Price: $ 10.00  (or 15000 Italian Lire)  for one license
          $  4.00  (or  6000 Italian Lire)  for each additional license

B) Vocpack 2.0 Library package:
   the Standard package plus the library files needed to build C programs
   which can read and write Vocpack files (see LIB.DOC for details).
   Any non-commercial 'executable file' (shareware or public domain) based
   on Vocpack 2.0 Library can be distributed royalty-free and without any
   special permission. The library files (*.LIB) must not be distributed
   with it, since they are licensed exclusively to the person who
   registered Vocpack 2.0 Library: you can give to others any file created
   with these tools but not the tools themselves. In addition you can't
   distribute an application that does nothing but decompressing Vocpack
   files (since this is what is missing in unregistered versions).

   Price: $ 20.00  (or 30000 Italian Lire)  for one license
          $  8.00  (or 12000 Italian Lire)  for each additional license
   
If you can't find a complete copy of Vocpack add $ 5.00 (or 7500 Italian
Lire) to your order and you will receive a disk containing the original
package.

To include any part of Vocpack in a commercial program you must obtain a
special license; ask for more information.
