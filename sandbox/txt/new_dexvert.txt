* Add music
  Here is where I should strongly consider adding some sort of 'prefix' type match type
  Whether I do that or not, I should also consider supporting renaming of files based on the file.preName instead of file.name

* Once this big is fixed: https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/12998

* Add archive

* Add executable

* Add video
  Start with something that uses dosBox and records a video

* Add document

* Add font
  Start with:
	font/amigaBitmapFont

* Add text
  Start with:
	text/txtByFilename

* Now the test-process test case should be working 100%

* Add additional conversions with 'libvips' (see CLI conversion) https://www.libvips.org/API/current/using-cli.html

* Remove the bottom comments in deark.js

* Get rid of the testdexvert TODO for allowing one day off and prevData.inputMeta check

* Find all remaining TODO comments (lintMyJSCode) and solve as many as I can

* Now start working on test/testid.js (start with image/pcx).
I do NOT actually have to manually 'record' anew for every file format, existing data is same.
So I should just be able to test entire families
./testid --format=image
Then fix an specific formats and record just those formats
If for whatever reason I do need to do it by hand, I wrote a script to help, just run util/testids.sh

* Now that id is all done, run both testdex and testid and both should be passing 100%

* Add all new dexvert paths to searchMyCode/shared/

* Find all remaining TODO comments (lintMyJSCode) and finish ALL of them or move to todo.txt

* Move whatever is left of DevLab/dexvert-node/ into DevLab/dexvert/sandbox/legacy/node/ then delete DevLab/dexvert-node/

* Delete dexvert on github and rename dexvert-deno to dexvert and update dexvert/.git/config remote url too

* Now email abydos Bergam and let him know about the new 'converters' column on the SUPPORTED.md page

* Now add dexvert back to the "roles" for crystalsummit in DevLab/node-modules/xpriv/hostUtil.js

* Now sync upload to chatsubo

* Do chatsubo system wide update

* Now get test/testid.js working 100% on chatsubo (this doesn't require dexserver be running)

* Now get dexserver and test/testdexvert.js working 100% on chatsubo

* Go through the sandbox/wip/misIdentified files and figure out where they go, then delete the misIdentified folder
  These are files that I believe DID convert, but do not actually appear to be the image they are assigned to, so need to determine what type they actually are

* Make a src/app/dexbrute.js that will run a given format for each and every program with a custom output path like /output/programid/ and will remove empty directories and output a final result too of what worked and what didn't

* Figure out what is 'eating' my input, see if I can reproduce it in a runUtil.test test and then see about fixing it in runUtil (I assume that's where it's happening)

* Try this as alternative to lobe, see how it does: https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/

* Make an apps.txt document for win2k/winxp that list the custom apps I installed, and where they are located and their version numbers and corresponding data/app/install.exe program
