LZEXE.EXE v0.91 (á-release) (c) 1989 Fabrice BELLARD
Compressor for EXE files.


This program is in the public domain (FREEWARE), and you can therefore
use, copy and distribute it freely.  You can also utilize it commercially,
i.e. you can use it on programs you intend to sell.  However, the sale of
LZEXE.EXE itself is forbidden.


Requirements:  PC and compatibles.  80286 or 80386 microprocessors are
recommended  for greater execution speed.


1-Introduction
--------------

This utility compresses EXE files, namely executable files, while
leaving them executable!


2-Using LZEXE
-------------

Usage is very simple: just enter the command line

                 LZEXE filename

where filename is the EXE file to be compressed.  The extension .EXE is
implied by default. "path" is optional: it refers to the directory where
the compacted file and the temporary working file LZTMP.EXE are to be
located.

There is a way to force LZEXE to accept a COM file: just use COMTOEXE by the
same author.  It works like EXE2BIN in reverse.

For greater safety LZEXE does not erase the original EXE file, but it renames
it with the extension .OLD.  In addition it creates the temporary file
LZEXE.TMP which is renamed with the name of the original program only at the
end of the compression process.

3-Usage tips
------------

Certain files can not be compressed for various reasons:

-  The file is not a true EXE file.  Solution: use COMTOEXE.EXE.
-  The relocation table is too large. To understand this you need to know
   the internal structure of an EXE file: such a file can occupy several
   segments unlike COM files.  Thus it must contain a table specifying where
   to branch and where to call subprograms, etc... And if the program is
   rather large  it may confuse the compressor.  I have provided for a table
   with up to 16,000 relocation addresses, which should suffice for almost
   all EXE files.
-  The file you wish to compress has already been compressed by LZEXE.
   Notice that there exists another compressor:   Microsoft's EXEPACK.EXE,
   which however is far less efficient than LZEXE.  LZEXE can further
   compress an EXEPACKed file, if you use UPACKEXE to unpack what EXEPACK
   has done.
-  Sometimes the compression factor is not significant.  This may happen with
   very small files (less than 2K).  Normally the compression is quite
   substantial.


-  A more serious problem: certain compressed EXE file may hang the system:

    -  If the program checks its size (like Turbo Debugger for example).
    -  If it checks for its integrity on disk.
    -  If it uses overlays, which must be loaded later and thus must occupy
       occupy fixed position in the file.  LZEXE 0.91 warns you of the
       presence of such overlays.
    -  Programs that require Microsoft's Windows:  they are not true EXE
       and will not work properly if compressed with LZEXE.
    -  This list may grow, since I have not experimented with all types
       of EXE files.


-  A less serious problem: Certain programs use configuration options that
   modify the code (Turbo  Pascal, for example).
   In this case, first configure the program, then compress it.  (Always
   keep an uncompressed version for safety.)


That's all!!!

    This decompressor is by itself a little jewel of 8086 assembler
programming. It goes without saying that it was hard work.  But the
compressor was not much easier, particularly with regard to the updating
all the pointers that the decompressor needs in order to function.
