CRUSH v1.0 - released 18th June 1994

  First version of CRUSH

CRUSH v1.1 - released 1st August 1994

  Bug fix for -f "optimiser" which sometimes prevented the very best archive
  being saved. Bug fix which cause CRUSH occasionally to overrun the required
  number of trials. Also a minor optimisation added to -f that almost always
  improves compression. v1.0 and v1.1 are completely cross-compatible and
  neither of the v1.0 bugs would cause invalid archives to be created.

CRUSH v1.2 - released 22nd August 1994

  Bug fix for -f when using CRUSH to create archives on a different drive
  than the current one. CRUSH v1.1 would report a invalid error and give up.
  Also when using CRUSH v1.1 to compress a group of zero-length files it
  would report a spurious percentage improvement. CRUSH no longer allows
  extension .CRU for external archive name (an invalid choice anyway).
  Extra optimisation added to -f when used with larger values (e.g. -f40).
  As before, all v1.0 and v1.1 archives are still valid and v1.2 compatible.

CRUSH v1.3 - released 30th October 1994

  Support for the new UC2 compressor added. UC2 outperforms ARJ and PKZIP
  for most applications.

CRUSH v1.4 - released 10th January 1995

  Problem fixed when recursing a large number of subdirectories.

CRUSH v1.8 - released 19th February 1995

  User can now compress up to 10,000,000 files in a single command rather
  than the previous 1,000 file limit. Options added to allow files/archive
  to be specified and the user can now define their own chosen archiver.
  The new -U option allows CRUSH to work more efficiently with Stacker and
  DoubleSpace.
