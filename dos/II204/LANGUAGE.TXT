My goal for the next few versions of InstallIt! is to add support for
languages other than English. In version 2.04 I have provided two
different methods of offering language selection to the user; the
programmer chooses the method that best suits his needs. There are
only six languages available currently, but with your help I hope
to offer more!

I do not have proficiency in any language other than English, so I need
the help of those whose native tongue is other than English to translate
the various prompts, instructions, and error messages in INSTALL. If you
feel inclined to help with a translation, PLEASE CONTACT ME FIRST at
coffeerp@adan.kingston.net (Rick Pedley) to find out whether the trans-
lation for the particular language you had in mind has not already been
done by someone else. (I especially still need French, but please check
with me first.)

To each person who first contacts me by email and provides a complete
translation in a particular language, I will give a free, single-user
licence registration key for InstallIt!, good for all current and
future releases of the program.

As new translations are received, they will be included in subsequent
versions of InstallIt!, beginning with version 2.04. They are freely
available on the Internet, and a registered user can register them using
the same key.

This document contains a list of all literal strings inside the INSTALL.EXE
file that must be translated into another language. I have tried to allow
a little extra space where possible, realizing that many languages require
more space than English to say the same thing. Please follow these general
rules when translating:

1. Use a DOS text editor that allows you to embed ALT-numeric keypad
   sequences for high-ASCII characters, e.g. ALT-1-6-4 prints "¤" (or
   key them in directly if your keyboard is set up for the language).
   Set the cursor to overstrike mode so the spacing is correctly
   maintained between the > and < delimiting symbols. Save the file as
   ASCII text, no formatting or printing commands in it. Don't use any
   characters below ASCII 32 (20 hex).

2. Maintain the same case, upper and lower, YES --> OUI, no --> non

3. Maintain the same punctuation, e.g. a comma or a colon at the end
   if one appears in the original text.

4. All text must be left-justified, and don't worry about spacing at
   either end of the text; spaces will be added later, automatically,
   where needed. So all of the space you see for a particular string
   is available for text. All text must fit inside the > < symbols below
   the English text.

5. A translated string can be shorter than the English equivalent, but
   NOT any longer. If there is not enough room, try a) re-phrasing the
   text so it has roughly the same meaning; b) omitting words like
   "the" and "a", e.g. Put a disk in the drive --> Put disk in drive;
   c) using abbreviations for long words. Below many of the items I
   offer replacement phrases that are synonyms for the originals;
   perhaps these will be easier or shorter to translate. Each of these
   begins with an * and are not intended to be edited.

6. In some cases I have added text inside []'s, to help indicate what
   a text string refers to. Don't try to translate anything inside the
   square brackets, and don't worry about adding spaces on either side
   of them; that is all taken care of. They are there only to provide
   context.
   
7. A translated string must not contain a double quotation mark (").
   Nor should there be any at either end of the string, just the < and
   > symbols.

8. Email this entire file as a file attachment, not as part of a message,
   to coffeerp@adan.kingston.net. Name it SWEDISH.TXT, FRENCH.TXT, etc.
