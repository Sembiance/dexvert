This is a Shareware copy of CRUSH v1.8

The documents MANUAL.DOC, README and QUESTION.DOC can be printed
directly to a conventional printer. Alternatively they can be read
into a Wordprocessor for printing using a Laser printer. If you do
this, then you should set the minimum margins that your Wordprocessor
allows, and select a 12 point Courier Font.
