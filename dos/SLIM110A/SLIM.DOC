        SLIM is a powerful file compressor with RAM resident  transparent 
        expander,  which gives painless access to compressed files.  This 
        is done by intercepting DOS calls, allowing applications to  read 
        compressed  files  just as before. So there is no need  to  worry 
        about  technicalities like archives. Just put a command  to  load 
        SLIM into the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and forget it.

        A  proprietary algorithm significantly compresses almost all  the 
        files  found  on PCs and gives big savings on disk  space.   More 
        than  half  of SLIM Ver 1.00 and 1.01 users who  responded  to  a 
        questionnaire said that SLIM allowed them to postpone or cancel a 
        hard disk upgrade. 

        A report facility shows which of a group of files are compressed, 
        by how much and with what total savings.

        SLIM's  compact  size  (less than 24KB) makes  it  practical  for 
        floppy as well as hard disk machines. 

        The RAM resident part of SLIM uses 73KB of main memory.

        System  Requirements:  IBM PC or MSDOS machine,  MSDOS Ver 2.00+, 
        256K+ RAM

        This  is for people who want to get on with using SLIM  and  read 
        about  it  later.  If you are new to SLIM, read on.  If  you  are 
        upgrading from an older version of SLIM, go to section 2.2.

         2.1 NEW USERS OF SLIM
             _________________

        To  get SLIM up and running,  you need only one  file,  SLIM.EXE. 
        This  contains  all  the functions  of  a  working  system.  Copy 
        SLIM.EXE your hard disk. The root directory is recommended.

        If  you  do not have a hard disk,  copy SLIM.EXE onto any  system 
        (boot)  disks you will use to boot your machine before  accessing 
        compressed  files.  It  is not necessary to have SLIM.EXE on  all 
        disks with compressed files, if you only need to read the files.

        If  your system disk has a file AUTOEXEC.BAT,  add a line to  the 
        file,  with  the text :  "SLIM ON".  This ensures that every time 
        your  computer is powered on,  compressed files can  be  accessed 
        normally. If you do not have a file AUTOEXEC.BAT, create one with 
        the same line.

          C>TYPE AUTOEXEC.BAT
          SLIM ON
          C>

        Re-boot  your system (Ctrl-Alt-Del).  The following message  will 
        appear when AUTOEXEC.BAT runs.

          C>SLIM ON

          Loading SLIM de-compressor
          C>

        This  indicates that the RAM resident part of SLIM is now loaded. 
        This  is needed to allow you to access compressed  files.  It  is 
        also  needed to de-compress compressed files (see section 5).  As 
        SLIM now occupies 72KB of RAM which was previously available  for 
        programs, some larger programs may not run with SLIM loaded. This 
        is  more  of a problem with systems containing 256K RAM,  but  if 
        your  machine  has 512K or more, you should have  no  difficulty. 
        Watch  out  for  applications  reporting  "insufficient  memory", 
        "program  too big to fit in memory" or not running after SLIM  is 
        loaded. Lack of RAM is the most likely cause of such a failure.

        Now your system is ready to handle compressed files. All you have 
        to  do  now is compress some,  and start saving  disk  space  (or 
        expanding your disk, if you prefer to see it that way).
                        S L I M   U s e r   M a n u a l         Pg 6


        Pick   one  or  more  files  for  compression.   As  this  is   a 
        familiarization exercise, take a small one (say, between 5000 and 
        30000 bytes), since compressing large files takes a lot of  time. 
        The  file  selected should also be one that you read  often,  but 
        write to seldom or never. An EXE or COM file is a good  candidate 
        on  this  basis,  but these don't compress as  well  as  text  or 
        program  source  code. Spreadsheets and database  files  compress 
        best,  but  they tend to be too large for our  present  purposes. 
        DON'T select a file that you need before SLIM is turned on,  e.g. 
        COMMAND.COM  or SLIM.EXE, as SLIM will refuse to compress  these. 
        (See  section 3 for more details.) Also, ensure that you have  at 
        least  as  many bytes free on your disk as the file you  wish  to 
        compress, because SLIM needs workspace to compress a file. 

        Let's  assume  you  chose to compress  the  DOS  utility  program 
        FIND.EXE. (I suggest this because it gives unusually good results, 
        at least in PC-DOS Version 3.00.) Type :

          C>SLIM FIND.EXE

        SLIM  displays  a  byte  counter when compressing  the  file  and 
        reports the saving when it is finished.

        In  the unlikely event that SLIM cannot compress the  file,  pick 
        another one. Most files are compressible.

        So you have liberated some disk space from FIND.EXE.  Now try  to 
        use the compressed file.

             C>FIND "SLIM" <AUTOEXEC.BAT
             SLIM ON
             C>

        As you can see,  FIND.EXE works just as before. SLIM works on all 
        sorts  of  files  just  as  easily,   word  processor  documents, 
        spreadsheets,  ASCII  files,  and peculiar unique files  used  by 
        various  software  packages.

        To see if a file or set of files is compressed,  and by how much, 
        use the SLIM R command. For example :

          C>

        But before you get carried away,  glance through the rest of this 
        manual.  You  could read it while SLIM crunches up some of  those 
        monstrous files that have been hogging your disk. 

         2.2 UPGRADING FROM AN EARLIER VERSION OF SLIM
             _________________________________________

        SLIM  V1.10  behaves pretty much the same as  versions  1.00  and 
        1.01.  It just does it faster and better. Files  compressed  with 
        the  earlier  versions can be used the same as  before.  However, 
        SLIM  V1.10 compresses somewhat better than its predecessors,  so 
        you  might find it worthwhile to expand and re-compress  the  old 
        files. See Section 9 for more information on changes.

        All copies of your earlier version of SLIM should be removed from 
        where  they might be used inadvertently. If you have stray  extra 
        copies of SLIM.EXE lying around, now would be a good time to  get 
        rid of them. The main reason for this is to avoid one version  of 
        SLIM  being  loaded  and another being used  afterwards.  If  two 
        versions  of  SLIM  from V1.10 on are mixed  in  this  way,  SLIM 
        outputs  an error message and refuses to work. The message  reads 
        "A different version of SLIM has been loaded. Use one only".

        Removal  of old versions is particularly important  for  versions 
        1.00 and 1.01. This is because the method of communicating with a 
        previously  loaded  RAM resident part (loaded by 'SLIM  ON')  has 
        been  changed  in  Version 1.10. So, for  example,  a  V1.00  RAM 
        resident  part will not realize that SLIM V1.10 is  'family'  and 
        will  expand files when an access is attempted. This  would  make 
        SLIM V1.10 take compressed files to be uncompressed. So confusion 
        results.

        of the RAM resident part of SLIM.

         3.1 BASIC OPERATION
             _______________

        Before files can be compressed, SLIM must have been loaded by the 
        SLIM ON command. This is because the compression process performs 
        a  check using the RAM resident de-compressor,  to guard  against 
        internal  bugs  which might prevent later access to a  compressed 
        file.

        Files can be compressed by entering :

          C>SLIM [n] filespec

        where 'filespec' is a filename including optional path. More than 
        one file can be compressed if wildcards ('*' or '?') are included 
        in  the filespec.  SLIM will take each file matching the filespec 
        and  attempt to compress it.  '[n]' is an optional number 0 to  9 
        which  alters the 'thoroughness' of the attempt to  compress  the 
        file(s).  This  will  not normally be used,  but see section  3.3 
        below for more information.

        As SLIM compresses each file, it displays a byte count indicating 
        the  progress  of compression.  If you want SLIM to skip a  file, 
        press any key and SLIM will abandon the file on the next  counter 
        update and proceed to the next file.

        When  a  file has been compressed,  the original  and  compressed 
        sizes are displayed on screen, as in the SLIM R command.

        If  SLIM encounters a file which is already compressed,  it  will 
        bypass it.

        When  all files have been processed,  SLIM displays a summary  of 
        bytes  saved  and  total bytes and bytes free on  the  disk.  See 
        example below.

         3.2 DISK SPACE REQUIRED
             ___________________

        SLIM  needs  some  workspace on  disk  to  compress  files.  When 
        compressing,  it  reads  the  original  file  and  produces   the 
        compressed  file, before deleting the original. To do this,  SLIM 
        needs  up  to as much free disk space as the largest file  to  be 
        compressed.  If SLIM runs out of disk space while  compressing  a 
        file,   it  will  output  an  error  message,  leave   the   file 
        uncompressed  and proceed to the next file. If you are  short  of 
        free  disk  space and wish to compress a number  of  files,  some 
        small and some large, compressing the small files first may  free 
        enough disk space to allow the large files to be compressed.

         3.3 COMPRESSION THOROUGHNESS
             ________________________

        When compressing files, SLIM can be instructed to 'try harder' or 
        'hurry  up' by specifying a compression  thoroughness  parameter. 
        This  is  done by inserting a number between 0 and 9  before  the 
        filespec. For example :

          C>SLIM 7 *.EXE

        will  compress  all  .EXE files in the current directory  with  a 
        thoroughness parameter of 7.  The parameter defaults to 5 if  not 
        specified.  A  higher value means a longer runtime and (possibly) 
        better  compression  performance.  A lower  value  means  shorter 
        runtime  and (possibly) worse compression.  These results are not 
        guaranteed,  however,  and  it may happen that a file  compressed 
        with a parameter of 6 is actually larger than one compressed with 
        a  parameter  of  5.  In addition for  larger  parameter  values, 
        runtime  tends to double for each increment in  parameter  value, 
        with little or no improvement in compression.  For these reasons, 
        it  is usually best to leave this parameter alone.  It should  be 
        reserved  for  when  you  badly  need  better  compression  on  a 
        particular file, or use a low value to quickly squash a few files 
        to give you some temporary disk space. 

         3.4 INCOMPRESSIBLE FILES
             ____________________

        Occasionally,  SLIM  will  encounter a  file  whose  'compressed' 
        size  is  actually larger than the original.  When this  happens, 
        SLIM  leaves the file uncompressed and outputs a  message  saying 
        that it cannot compress the file.

         3.5 RUNTIME
             _______

        File compression take a long time compared to the small delay  on 
        access.  Fortunately, compression is an infrequent task and  only 
        needs to be repeated when new files are added to the disk or when 
        files have been written to. Files which are frequently written to 
        should  not be compressed. The short term gain of disk  space  is 
        outweighed  by  the time taken to re-compress the  file  and  the 
        inconvenience of running compression often.
                        S L I M   U s e r   M a n u a l         Pg 10



        Large  quantities  of files can be compressed overnight  using  a 
        batch file.  If the batch file is still running when you need the 
        machine  again,  it can be safely interrupted by  pressing  Ctrl-
        Break.  The  batch  file can be re-started later  and  SLIM  will 
        quickly skip over files already compressed. Here are some example 
        batch files for compressing large numbers of files.

          C>TYPE SLIM1.BAT
          REM COMPRESS ALL FILES IN WS DIRECTORY
          C:\SLIM C:\WS\*.*
          C>
          C>TYPE SLIM2.BAT
          REM COMPRESS ALL FILES IN :
          REM WS, WS\DATA, SYMPH, SYMPH\DATA, DBASE, DOS ETC.
          C:\SLIM \WS\*.*
          C:\SLIM \WS\DATA\*.*
          C:\SLIM \SYMPH\*.*
          C:\SLIM \SYMPH\DATA\*.*
          C:\SLIM \WS\*.*
          C:\SLIM \DBASE\*.*
          C:\SLIM \DOS\*.*
          C:\SLIM \XTREE\*.*
          C>
          C>TYPE SLIM3.BAT
          REM COMPRESS ALL FILES IN :
          REM WS, WS\DATA, SYMPH, SYMPH\DATA, ETC.
          FOR %%X IN ( WS WS\DATA SYMPH ) DO C:\SLIM \%%X\*.*
          FOR %%X IN ( SYMPH\DATA DBASE DOS XTREE ) DO C:\SLIM \%%X\*.*
          C>

        The  last  of these examples is the most useful.  By  customizing 
        SLIM3.BAT  to  your own machine's directory  structure,  you  can 
        compress  all the files in some or all of your  directories.  The 
        batch  file  can  be  re-run at intervals to  catch  any  new  or 
        rewritten  files. When you change your directory structure,  edit 
        the batch file accordingly.

         3.6 FORBIDDEN FILES
             _______________

        Compressed  files  can  only  be  correctly  read  when  SLIM  is 
        activated,  using  the  SLIM  ON  command.  This  command   would 
        typically be in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. But certain files must  be 
        read  on  power  up,  before  SLIM  is  activated.  Examples  are 
        COMMAND.COM, CONFIG.SYS and of course, SLIM.EXE. If any of  these 
        files were compressed, the computer could not power up  properly. 
        To prevent this, SLIM refuses to compress any files with a ".SYS" 
        extension   and   any  files  called   COMMAND.COM,   IBMBIO.COM, 
        IBMDOS.COM,  AUTOEXEC.BAT or SLIM.EXE. If SLIM encounters any  of 
        these  files during compression, it outputs a message saying  the 
        file should not be compressed.

         4.1 CONFIGURING YOUR SYSTEM WITH SLIM
             _________________________________

        To ensure access to compressed files, enter the command 'SLIM ON' 
        in  your  AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Make sure that this command  occurs 
        before any commands that access compressed files. For example, if 
        you compress SK.COM, and you have the command SK in AUTOEXEC.BAT, 
        you must place the 'SLIM ON' command before the 'SK' command.

        If you do not wish to have SLIM permanently loaded, which may  be 
        the  case if you have an application that needs lots  of  memory, 
        make  sure to enter the SLIM ON command before attempting  access 
        to  any compressed files. Once SLIM is loaded into memory by  the 
        SLIM  ON command, it cannot be removed, except by restarting  the 
        computer (Ctrl-Alt-Del).

         4.2 HOW COMPRESSED FILES ARE ACCESSED
             _________________________________

        Once loaded,  SLIM gives automatic access on demand to compressed 
        files.   It  does  this  by  intercepting  any  calls  a  program 
        (including COMMAND.COM) makes to DOS. Normally, SLIM passes these 
        calls straight on to DOS, but when a call is detected which opens 
        a compressed file, SLIM reads the file and makes a full size copy 
        on disk for the program to use.  It then changes the name of  the 
        compressed  file  to a name it recognizes itself and renames  the 
        new full size file to the original file name.  Only then does  it 
        pass  the call on to DOS.  Neither DOS nor the program know  that 
        this is happening,  so operation is completely automatic. When an 
        expanded  file  is closed without being modified,  SLIM  (equally 
        quietly)  deletes  the  expanded copy and  renames  the  original 
        compressed  file to its original name.  If a program modifies  an 
        expanded copy of a file, SLIM deletes the compressed original and 
        leaves the expanded new file on disk.

        Compressed  files  may  be  renamed  without  affecting   access. 
        Compressed  files  can also be deleted.  If a compressed file  is 
        copied to another file with SLIM ON,  the new file will be a full 
        size, not a compressed, copy of the original. 

         4.3 COPYING AND BACKING UP COMPRESSED FILES
             _______________________________________

        In some circumstances,  you may wish to manipulate files  without 
        expanding   them.   Copying   and  backing  up  files  are   such 
        circumstances. The command SLIM OFF is provided for this  reason. 
        It  prevents SLIM from expanding files when opened, but does  not 
        remove SLIM from memory or prevent it expanding a COM or EXE file 
        when it is run.
                        S L I M   U s e r   M a n u a l         Pg 12


        Do not forget to turn SLIM ON again when the copying or backup is 
        complete. If in doubt, an extra SLIM ON command will not hurt. To 
        see  if  SLIM is ON or OFF enter the command SLIM and the  status 
        will displayed, INACTIVE meaning OFF and ACTIVE meaning ON.

        If you mistakenly access a file with SLIM OFF or not loaded,  the 
        file  will not make sense,  but the error will be  obvious.  Most 
        programs  report in a fairly civilized manner when a file is  not 
        what they expect.  If the compressed file is accessed as an ASCII 
        or text file,  the file will seem to contain the message '= sLiM' 
        and  nothing  else.  If  a program in a compressed  COM  file  is 
        mistakenly  run  without  SLIM  loaded,  the  program  will  stop 
        immediately.

         4.4 DISK SPACE
             __________

        Because  SLIM  makes  a  full size copy  of  each  file  that  is 
        accessed, there must be enough disk space free to accommodate all 
        the full size copies that will be need at any one time. This does 
        not,  however, include full size copies of COM or EXE files  that 
        are  being  run,  as these are  deleted  immediately  when  their 
        contents are loaded into memory.

        This can be illustrated by the following example.

        I  will run WS.COM (a well known word processor) to edit the file 
        DOCUMENT.TXT.  The files WS.COM,  WSOVLY1.OVR and WSMSGS.OVR  are 
        compressed,  as is DOCUMENT.TXT.  WS.COM uses data in WSOVLY1.OVR 
        and  WSMSGS.OVR,  so it accesses these.  So my disk must have  at 
        least 46080 + 32256 + 19840 = 98176 bytes free. (More accurately, 
        it  must  have 48K + 32K + 20K = 100K bytes free, since  data  is 
        stored  on  the disk in units no smaller then 2K.) I  don't  need 
        25600  bytes  for WS.COM as this is  only  expanded  transiently, 
        until loaded into memory. But I do need to have 25600 bytes  free 
        just to run WS.COM.

        Don't panic!  You do NOT need a calculator to use SLIM. The above 
        information  is  provided  so  that you will  know  (a)  what  is 
        happening,  if  it happens,  and (b) what must be done to stop it 
        happening.  If you prefer,  do what you did last time you ran out 
        of disk space - start deleting files.

        When  SLIM  runs out of disk space on expansion,  it  returns  an 
        'Access  denied'  error as a response to the DOS  call,  but  the 
        message on screen may not make this obvious.  For example, if you 
        try to execute a compressed .EXE file,  and SLIM fails to  expand 
        it,  the  message that appears on screen is 'Bad command or  file 
        name'.

        SLIM  will also be unable to expand a file if the file is in  the 
        root directory of a disk and the root directory is full. A little 
        known  peculiarity  of DOS is that the root directory of  a  disk 
        (for  example A:\) can store only a limited number  of  directory 
        entries (filenames). The limit is normally 112 for a 360K  floppy 
        disk and 512 for a hard disk. Since the volume label occupies one 
        directory entry, the practical limit is 111 and 511 respectively. 
        Sometimes  people  find this out the hard way when they  try  for 
        example to copy 200 1K files onto a floppy disk.
        If a compressed file is in a full root directory, SLIM will  fail 
        to  produce  an expanded copy. To check if this is the  cause  of 
        failure,  try  copying files (with SLIM turned OFF) and  if  this 
        fails even though enough disk space is free, a full directory  is 
        the probable cause. A remedy to a full root directory is to  copy 
        all  or  some files into a sub-directory  (after  freeing  enough 
        space  to create the sub-directory). Even if you do not need  the 
        files to be compressed, a nearly full root directory is likely to 
        cause further trouble.

        Do  not put a  write protect tab on a floppy disk if you want  to 
        access compressed files on that disk, as this prevents generation 
        of an expanded copy.  This is not a problem, however, if you only 
        use  the disk for file storage.  The file may be copied from  the 
        write protected disk with SLIM turned OFF,  and then accessed  on 
        an unprotected disk, with SLIM turned ON.

         4.5 TRANSPARENCY FAILURES
         _________________________

        SLIM gives programs the illusion that small files are big  files. 
        It does this very successfully and almost all of the software  is 
        fooled  all  of  the time. But there are  some  cases  where  the 
        illusion  cannot  be maintained and compression  must  be  either 
        avoided or done carefully.

        The first case is where a program obtains the size of a file from 
        its  directory entry and then reads that number of bytes when  it 
        opens  the file. The intention is to read the whole file, but  if 
        the  file  is  compressed,  only the number  of  bytes  that  the 
        compressed  file occupies are read. This behavior has  been  seen 
        with  the  DOS XCOPY command (Ver 3.21 at least) and  PKZIP  (Ver 
        1.01 at least) from PKWARE.

        A  solution  is to change the name of the offending  program  and 
                        S L I M   U s e r   M a n u a l         Pg 14


        replace  it  with  a batch file that turns  SLIM  off,  runs  the 
        program, and turns SLIM on again. For example :

          C>TYPE XCOPY.BAT
          REM
          REM XCOPY WITH SLIM OFF.
          REM PREVENTS TRUNCATION AND PRESERVES COMPRESSION.
          REM
          SLIM OFF
          OLDXCOPY %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
          SLIM ON
          C>

        The  second  case  where  SLIM  confuses  other  software  is   a 
        particular  copy  protection method. The method bypasses  DOS  to 
        read the disk area in which the program is presumed to be stored, 
        to  check it is still there. The details of where this is on  the 
        user's  disk  is  written into the  program  by  an  installation 
        program.  If an ordinary copy of the program is run, it will  see 
        that  its own code is not in the expected place on disk. It  then 
        'knows'  that an unauthorized copy is being used.  Variations  on 
        this  theme use other files apart from the program file or  check 
        the  file allocation table instead of the data area of the  disk. 
        Programs  copy protected by these means tend to have warnings  in 
        the documentation against copying the program file or files.

        When SLIM compresses a file, it reads the original, writes a  new 
        file  on a different area of disk and deletes the original.  This 
        causes the copy protection method to be activated. 

        The obvious remedy here is to not compress files subject to  such 
        a copy protection scheme. If you must compress such files, it may 
        be  possible to get an unprotected copy of the software from  the 
        vendor.  Since  copy protection has become unpopular, it  is  not 
        likely  that this problem will happen with any new  software  you 
        acquire.

         5.1 BASIC OPERATION
             _______________

        The SLIM X (eXpand) command de-compresses a file or set of files. 
        This command can only be used if SLIM has been made RAM  resident 
        with the SLIM ON command. Example :

         5.2 DISK SPACE REQUIRED
             ___________________

        For  SLIM X to execute correctly,  enough free disk space must be 
        available  to  store an expanded file as well as  the  compressed 
        file,  because the compressed file is only deleted after the  de-
        compressed file is produced.

         6.1 FILES USED BY SLIM
             __________________

        Using  SLIM,  you  will occasionally glimpse files  with  strange 
        names   lurking   on   your  disk.   SLIM   uses   files   called 
        'SLIMnnnn.$$$'  where  nnnn is a four digit decimal  number.  The 
        other  files  are  the compressed originals of  open  files  (See 
        Section  4.2). These will be seen if, for example, you call up  a 
        directory  display  in a word processor whose working  files  are 
        compressed.

        If you see any files of the type 'SLIMnnnn.$$$' when you are SURE 
        that  you do not have any compressed files open (for example,  on 
        power  up),  this indicates power loss or other failure when  the 
        file was being accessed.  Rename the file to something else (e.g. 
        WHATISIT.FOR) and use the SLIM R command to see the original file 
        size.  If  that size is the same as that of another file  in  the 
        same  directory,  then  WHATISIT.FOR is probably  the  compressed 
        original  of that file.  If you are sure that WHATISIT.FOR is not 
        an older version of a revised file,  rename it to the filename of 
        your choice and continue to use it. Otherwise, delete it.

         6.2 RAM RESIDENT INTERFACE
             ______________________

        When SLIM is loaded, the RAM resident part is kept in memory.  It 
        is necessary for the non-resident part to communicate with it for 
        a number of reasons. One reason is to turn it on and off. Another 
        is  to  verify  (after compressing a file) that  a  file  can  be 
        accessed.  This is a safety measure to protect against a  bug  in 
        SLIM, which virtually guarantees that SLIM will never cause  loss 
        of data. A third reason is to use the RAM resident part to expand 
        a compressed file (X command).

        The   interface  to  SLIM's  RAM  resident  part   supports   the  
        TesSeRact(TM)  Standard  for  Ram-Resident Program Communication.

         8.1 SUPPORT POLICY
             ______________

        I  have good reason to believe that my software is more  reliable 
        than most in the computer industry, and I intend to keep it  that 
        way.  If  you have a problem with SLIM, that  means  that  either 
        there  is a bug in the software or the manual is  misleading.  In 
        either  case,  I  want to know about it. I gladly  offer  a  free 
        upgrade  of SLIM to any registered user for a usable  bug  report 
        (whether it was reported previously or not).

        If  you don't have a problem, but have suggestions  or  comments, 
        I'd like to see them.

         8.2 WHAT TO SEND
             ____________

        If  you  are  reporting some abnormal behavior by  SLIM,  I  will 
        probably need to see it to be of any help. The more complete  the 
        information you provide, the quicker and more helpful my response 
        can be. Ideally, you should send a floppy disk with a README file 
        containing  your  explanation  of the  problem.  It  should  also 
        include  copies  of all files involved. If I can see a  bug,  I'm 
        most  of  the  way to fixing it. I undertake  to  use  any  files 
        received in this way for debugging only and to destroy all copies 
        when that is done.

        Please  make  sure the problem still happens when you  boot  your 
        system  without  an AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS file. If  you  can 
        make  it happen using only the files on the floppy disk  you  are 
        sending,  and not your hard disk, then it is fairly sure  that  I 
        can reproduce the problem.

        It is usually easier to include a batch file than to explain what 
        to type. Please mention what DOS version you use (MSDOS or  PCDOS 
        with numbers), your machine (manufacturer, CPU type, RAM.  etc.), 
        and anything else you think may be relevant.

        Version : 1.00           Released : November 1988

        This is the initial release of SLIM.


        Version : 1.01           Released : April 1989

        The  shareware version previously demonstrated compressibility of 
        files  larger than 64K.  Since this can be time-consuming,  large 
        files are now skipped over. Licensed version behaves as before.


        Version : 1.10           Released : February 1991

        Compression is typically many times faster for large files  (over 
        64KB approx.).
        Expansion is at least 50% faster for large files. Bigger  savings 
        for small files.
        Compression is improved significantly. Users of earlier  versions 
        should re-compress their files when convenient.
        Work space on disk used when compressing files reduced to half. 
        SLIM.EXE is reduced from over 30KB to less than 22KB.
        Shareware edition of SLIM now compresses files of unlimited size.
        Various bugs fixed.
