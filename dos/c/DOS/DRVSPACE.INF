; Microsoft DriveSpace Setup Information File
;
; This file customizes the behavior of DriveSpace when it is compressing
; existing drives or creating new drives.

;
; Commands under [SpecialFiles] indicate actions to be taken for specific
; files; the options are COPY=filename, IGNORE=filename, and MOVE=filename.
; Without a path, any file of that name will match; wildcards (?, *) are
; acceptable.
;
;   COPY=
;     Specified file(s) are copied to compresed drive, and left behind on the
;     uncompressed drive.
;
;   IGNORE=
;     Specified file(s) are left behind on the uncompressed drive.
;
;   MOVE=
;     Specified file(s) are moved to the compressed drive.  This is the
;     default behavior for all files, except those with the SYSTEM attribute.
