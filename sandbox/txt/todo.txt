* Continue working on extracting content out of MMM files such as: https://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/1312/Neurodancer.iso/PCND16.MMM
  I've reached out to the deark creator to see if they could possibly add support for this format to deark.

* Add fileMeta checks for all these: https://www.kreativekorp.com/miscpages/a2info/filetypes.shtml

* https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/2024/04/05/shorten/
  https://github.com/thorsted/PRONOM_Research/tree/main/Submissions/Shorten

* https://github.com/32bitkid/sci.js/tree/main/apps/scibud
  Detection: the most simplistic heuristic for SCI games would be the existence of a RESOURCE.MAP file with one or more files "pack", like RESOURCE.001. There are other checks/fingerprinting to use to be more specific, but that's usually a pretty good sign that it's an SCI game.

* Ensure NeXT format discs are supported by checking some of the CD's here: https://blog.persistent.info/2024/03/infinite-mac-nextstep.html
  Note that it mentions 2 different filesystem formats, HFS and UFS?
  Make sure I have oshints for next charset: https://github.com/mihaip/infinite-mac/blob/main/scripts/nextstep.py

* Sort this list of supported formats by library/engine and ensure dexvert supports each engine and every format in that engine
  Download the samples on this page and add em to mine.
  Prioritize non-video games
  http://bzrplayer.blazer.nu/formats.php

* This person made a Sierra SCI0 pic renderer in JavaScript: https://github.com/32bitkid/sci.js/tree/main/apps/scibud
  See if I can leverage it to convert/extract SCI0 pics from SCI0 files. May want to reach out on Mastadon/GitHub

* Add OS/2 support by either using OS/2 Warp 4.5.2 (winworld) on 86Box or by using ArcaOS (was blue lion) in vbox/vmware: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utse8P_L8k0
  Then add format support for:
	archive/os2FTCOMP
	archive/os2InstallPackage
	archive/iconHeaven
	image/pmDraw
	document/os2Help	(https://hobbes.nmsu.edu/?path=%2Fpub%2Fos2%2Futil%2Fconvert)

* image/amosPicturePacker currently is only supported by abydos and it doesn't always get it right.
  It also doesn't associated .pal palette files: https://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/2209/Assassins%203%20-%20The%20Ultimate%20Games%20CD%20(1997)(Weird%20Science)[!][Amiga-CD32-CDTV].iso/play_zone/animal_pairs/pictures
  Perhaps get deark to add support for this format.

* Improve 'fragile' formats (these are very sensitive and sometimes convert OK, sometimes don't. May be CPU load related, may be something else):
  archive/hypercard						Sometimes certain cards/bitmaps don't render
  archive/windowsResource				Converter program is sensitive, would like to find a better resource ripper, maybe even code my own
  audio/downloadableSoundBank			Sometimes not all .mp3 files are produced (shell.dls)
  document/hlp & multimediaViewerBook	Sometimes things don't convert under CPU load, several files just don't show up
  document/pageMaker					The program (especially pagemaker7) may be sensitive as often it will end up converting with older converters
  font/amigaBitmapFont					Program Fony appears to be sensitive, sometimes it converts, sometimes not.
  image/harvardGraphicsChart			When running tests, I only get an output image about 50% of the time
  music/smus							Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. aboutmodern.smus is particularily sensitive

* Found several BitRock installers on DiscMaster:http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=BitRock+Installer&qfields=content&formatid=xml
  I tried using this extractor: https://gist.github.com/mickael9/0b902da7c13207d1b86e
  But failed to get it to extract anything. See my progress and overlay ebuilds in sandbox/app/bitrock-unpacker/

* Add support music/fuxoftAYLanguage and music/ayAMAD
  Ay_Emul can play both these, but it doesn't have CLI conversion support so I could do either:
  1. Add CLI conversion support to Ay_Emul (see email about building it from svbulba@gmail.com)
  2. Patch ZXtune (which uses Ay_Emul) to support these formats
     If I do ZXTune, submit patch here: https://bitbucket.org/zxtune/zxtune/issues/150/ay-amad-support
     In EITHER CASE, make sure I'm using the latest versions of both the above before trying

* Add POVRAY rendering support (see the extensive notes in povRay.js)
  Example files: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/15720/Disk18.iso/ZIPS/POV@.EXE/POV
  Other POV files: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=pov&qfields=ext&family=text&dedup=dedup

* InstallShield cab extraction can be problematic as unshield doesn't work correctly with everything.
  For example CABS from: https://archive.org/details/250TCF
  They take up 653MB of space but only 62MB is extracted.
  Possible options: https://community.flexera.com/t5/InstallShield-Knowledge-Base/Installshield-Setup-exe-Command-Line-Parameters/ta-p/4270
  Or maybe try installing Install Shield authoring itself to see if I can open them or build an extractor or something:
	https://archive.org/details/install-shield-6.2-pro-std.-7z
	https://archive.org/details/installshield1150premier

* Now that Print to File/PDF works better, should now be able to support:
  document/greenstreetPublisher (Open in win2k (or winxp) with Publishing Suite 99)

* Now that I emulate a real sound card with 86Box, I may be able to support music/famiTracker in winxp. See note

* ISOs I was unable to process:
	No idea what format this is in: https://archive.org/details/Royal_Tyrrell_Museum_Virtual_Tour_2003_WIN98
	These don't convert for some reason, they both appear to be Mac CDs
		https://archive.org/details/800_jeux_pour_mac		This one has an extra 16 bytes at front, removing it doesn't fix it, but did allow UniExtract to extract a TOAST partition, but couldn't process that at all either
		https://archive.org/details/Lex-C-RomSharewareExpress	no idea on this one
	Raw mac partition dumps:
		https://archive.org/details/apple-r-p-lib-internal-v-1.0
		https://archive.org/details/apple-r-p-lib-internal-v-2.0
		https://archive.org/details/apple-r-p-lib-reseller-v-1.0_202007

* Add 'proper' AskSam support: https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/2024/01/26/asksam/
  Right now I just have it as a 'simple' file using strings, of which I already have some samples for

* Add moRay support. See format moRay.js for notes

* With wine (or win7) I can add support for the 'sgs.dat' file from the 'Hyper Animation games (sandbox/app/DecomposeSGS)'
  There are only a handful of these files (14), so it's not a high priority

* Might be fun to detect MacOS kalideoscope themes and grab the individual images and render some sort of 'preview' of it: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=%22Minimum+Kaleidoscope+version%22&qfields=content&family=text&dedup=dedup
  If I name the preview something like kalideoscope_preview_dexvert.png then I can find them more easily


/--------------\
| Low Priority |

* It might be fun to write a parser for this obscure format: https://breakintochat.com/wiki/Instant_Graphics_and_Sound_(IGS)
  It's documented pretty well in sandbox/app/IGSED25.ZIP  -> MODEMS/MOD_A2L/IGSED25/IGS217.TXT
  It also does sound and music though, so maybe this is more of an archive producing both images and audio? or maybe a video?

* So meshlab (https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/meshlab) uses vcglib which has support for these 3D formats: PLY, STL, OFF, OBJ, 3DS, COLLADA, PTX, V3D, PTS, APTS, XYZ, GTS, TRI, ASC, X3D, X3DV, VRML, ALN
  Sadly the version in Gentoo as of Mar 2024 is 4 years old and attempts to compile it myself yielded a lost afternoon and lots of frustration

* Freecad (already in portage) has several formats: STEP, IGES, OBJ, STL, DXF, SVG, DAE, IFC or OFF, NASTRAN, VRML, FCStd  (from https://wiki.freecad.org/Feature_list)
  But it pulls in 40 other packages, some of them quite large including additional slotted versions of CLANG. Yuck. Pass for now.
  It also has additional addons' that support other formats from: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons

* Add DOS printing support to DOSBox with a patch from: https://sourceforge.net/p/dosbox/patches/?limit=250
  I've downloaded the patch and the required fonts.zip to sandbox/app/virtualPrinter/
  Once I have that I could support certain formats like:
	document/dartHypertext
	document/envisionPublisherDoc
	document/ibmStoryboardDocument

* So 'xv' claims to have supprt for image/yanagisawaPIC2
  I compiled the latest version from: https://github.com/jasper-software/xv   (archived copy in sandbox/app/xv.tar.gz)
  The version above has all the patches that are out there, including the jumbo patches and makes it so it builds on modern linux
  But it couldn't open any of my sample PIC2 files.
  If I were to get it to load them, I'd also have to add a command line '-convert' flag to auto convert the picture to .ppm

* Create a util/openVNCWindows.js <host> that will dynamically determine how to open all the VNC windows
  Probably update wine and os to record down in a ram dexvert file which VNC ports are being listened on
  If host is omitted or is localhost then open locally.
  If host is a remote host then use vncRemote command

* Get someone to convert this really old UNIX code to compiled under modern linux (git cloned a copy into sandbox/app/): https://github.com/hkaiser/TRiAS/tree/master/Kartenverarbeitung/Imtools
  Go through formats it supports (see programs_formats.txt) and try them out against dexvert test cases and consider adding to dexvert

* Would be nice to take this Java program and make a CLI conversion program from it's code (git cloned a copy into sandbox/app/): https://github.com/kreativekorp/powerpaint
  I submitted an issue on their GitHub asking if that would be possible, or at least some help in which classes/methods to use to make it happen
  Go through formats it supports (see programs_formats.txt) and try them out against dexvert test cases and consider adding to dexvert

* This program is able to identify, extract and convert hundreds of visual novel file formats: https://github.com/morkt/GARbro
  It's written in C# .net but targets an old version 4.6. It also references several DLLs that they don't provide.
  The author has said that they are proprietary and he doesn't care that it won't compile anyhere else. The main build is years old.
  There is no working Console support, but there is a pull request that tries to fix that: https://github.com/morkt/GARbro/pull/394/commits   (https://github.com/Bioruebe/GARbro/tree/2112bde1cc13eb817b8d541c3bcc7a68c4f71883)
  I've saved the full source code (as of Feb 2024) WITH the pull request merged to: sandbox/app/GARbro.tar.bz2
  With compilation not being an option and the build being so old (it didn't work right under wine anyways, I tried) just the code is useful
  What needs to happen is I need to examine the code closely, see how it 'detects' formats, 'extracts' and 'converts'
  Then I need to make a new .net mono project and slowly bring over the code, 1 file at a time, writing new API stub backings as needed
  That's a TON of work. So while it would be awesome to detect these formats and handle them, it's on the back burner for a while
  If I do do it, get 'detection' working first as another 'detect' program. Then get extraction and use these samples:
	test/sample/unsupported/visualNovel/
	test/sample/archive/fat12/*/*
  	https://archive.org/details/pc-98_20230120
  	https://www.pc98.org/main.html

  	Old IADL (http://iadl.retromission.com/items?collectionid=cd-roms&collectionid=cdrom_contributions&collectionid=cdromimages&collectionid=cdromsoftware&collectionid=%40asromix&collectionid=%40gingerbeardman&collectionid=%40iamxray&collectionid=%40pascal_of_irate&collectionid=%40sembiance&collectionid=%40shivashaw&collectionid=adultcdroms&collectionid=ftpsites&collectionid=softwarecapsules&collectionid=softwarelibrary_mature&subject=visual%20novel&title=&priority=999&minfiles=0&maxfiles=0&minsize=0&maxsize=0&limit=1000)

* See if I can detect and extract the compressed files in sandbox/fail/unsupportedCompression/*
  Maybe something from: https://www.sac.sk/files.php?d=7&l=

* Add OS X support, running under something like vbox/vmware.
  Then add programs:
	Graphic Converter (https://www.lemkesoft.de/en/products/graphicconverter/key-features/import-and-export-formats
	First test on my real mac to see if I can convert files via CLI (check PCX, AOL Art, etc) (see Help->CLI Commands)
	If CLI works then try getting it working in a virtual machine of some sort, something more portable than QEMU
	To run the supervisor.sh script on boot: https://www.karltarvas.com/2020/09/11/macos-run-script-on-startup.html
  Add format support:
	archive/sparseImage

* Add Classic MacOS support so the following can be supported:
	These seem to be Disk Copy 5/6, which I may be able to extract/convert with: http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/disk-copy-6
	  https://archive.org/details/GigaROM2.0.img
	  https://archive.org/details/InfoMac5Disk1.img
	  https://archive.org/details/InfoMac5Disk2.img

* Add RISC OS support, with one of these emulators:
	https://www.marutan.net/rpcemu/index.php
	http://arcem.sourceforge.net/
	http://b-em.bbcmicro.com/arculator/
	http://www.virtualacorn.co.uk/product.htm  (only runs on Windows)
	http://www.riscos.com/shop/products/106/index.htm  
  Will want to find CineWorks application and probably stick to version 3.x of RiscOS: https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/5/topics/248?page=2
  Then add support for:
	unsupported/audio/audioWorksSoundSample
	video/acornReplayVideo
  More samples from:
	https://archive.org/details/cine-clips
	https://archive.org/details/acorn_replay_collection
	https://archive.org/details/cdrom-riscos-clipart
	https://archive.org/details/cdrom-riscos-risc-disc-1

* Add Old 32bit Linux support then add (see notes for each format):
  music/beRoTracker
  music/synderSNG

* Create dexvert.com with a 'Browse' button that allows you to upload files to convert.
  Bonus points if I make a quick dirty 'dexvert.sh' bash script that folks can use that will convert via wget from CLI via dexvert.com
  WARNING! I need to assume that it will be exploited since I run so many programs, many of which likely have exploits.
  So I will want to research how to run programs within some sort of jailbreak, or leverage the docker image with multiple instances

* Add rendering of previews of full game maps supported by 'gamemap': https://github.com/Malvineous/libgamemaps
  Research them here: https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net

* Could incorporate a new detectory, the DOS based identification program sandbox/app/idar215.exe (self extractor) http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/IDArc
  Due to the overhead with DOSBox, would want to use 'dosemu2' to run this directrly from the linux console: https://github.com/dosemu2/dosemu2
  I got it to install and compile, but the freedos (fdpp) linking wasn't correct yet and it failed to run IDARCH.EXE


/----------------\
| Probably Never |
\----------------/
* Use a doom2vrml program to make doom levels browseable: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/6095/WIN95_09962.iso/vrml/dm2v-10.zip  or  http://www.ocnus.com/doom.html
  I tried DM2VRML.EXE a little bit, it crashes a lot. Also, I had trouble locating Doom 1 WADs, but found lots of DOOM 2 wads.

* Add this detection program: https://github.com/google/magika
  It only detects a small handful of file formats, more modern ones too.
  For that one, I'll need to spin up a server in dexvert that runs in the background as python and responses to web requests
  Make sure I also put it on info.txt App Updates section

* Pay someone to add more formats to FFMPEG (gl/dl/ANIM/etc) or to improve existing formats: http://www.ffmpeg.org/consulting.html

* Consider switching away from DOSBOX and use an authentic MS-DOS installation under 86Box
   Pro: Compatability with some dexvert/dos/* programs that didn't work under dosbox (of which I don't know of any). Feels cleaner.
  Cons: Would need to solve video recording & keyboard control (both of which I wrote custom code patches to DOSBOX to implement)
  I could maybe add similar code to 86Box, but that would be harder to control from 'within' dos.
  It's probably not worth doing since I can't think of many 'benefits' and what I have with DOSBox "works ok"

* Add 3DO support. Ideally via mount using dexvert/sandbox/app/operafs but I'd need to update that code to compile against modern linux kernel
  Other 3DO extractor programs: https://forum.uqm.stack.nl/index.php?topic=3535.0
  Some additional OperaFS programs: http://altmer.arts-union.ru/3DO/3do_utils.htm

* Try and get support added to linux kernel for mounting CDI images. Seems like a tall order.
  Could ask on IRC OFTC #kernelnewbies and ##linux on freenode about where I could find someone who could do this, and maybe pay them to do it
  https://www.isobuster.com/help/cd-i_and_vcd
  https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Green+Book+CD-ROM
  https://www.lscdweb.com/data/downloadables/2/8/cdi_may94_r2.pdf
  See some tools in sandbox/app/CD-i Image Decoding Tools rhdn.zip
  Additional tools for CD-I from here (including animation stuff): https://archive.org/details/various.cd-i.utilities.3.5hd.os9

* Create native C nodejs module for imagemagick/recoil and other libs (abydos, etc) for speed. Example existing image magick one: https://github.com/elad/node-imagemagick-native
