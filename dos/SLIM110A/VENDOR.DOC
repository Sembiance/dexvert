		DESCRIPTION OF SLIM

SLIM is a powerful file compressor with RAM resident transparent expander,
which gives painless access to compressed files. This is done by intercepting
DOS calls, allowing applications to read compressed files just as before.
So there is no need to worry about technicalities like archives. Just put a
command to load SLIM into the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and forget it.

A proprietary algorithm significantly compresses almost all the files found
on PCs and gives big savings on disk space. More than half of SLIM Ver 1.00
and 1.01 users who responded to a questionnaire said that SLIM allowed them
to postpone or cancel a hard disk upgrade. 

SLIM's compact size (less than 24KB) makes it practical for floppy as well as
hard disk machines. The RAM resident part of SLIM uses 73KB of main memory.
System Requirements: IBM PC or MSDOS machine, MSDOS Ver 2.00+, 256K+ RAM

		DISTRIBUTION OF SLIM

SLIM is a "shareware program", and is provided at no charge to the user for

given away altered or as part of another system. If you find SLIM useful,
and that you continue to use it after a reasonable trial period, you must
make a registration payment to the author. All registered users will receive
a copy of the latest version of SLIM, along with the other benefits of 
registration. See Section 10 of the manual SLIM.DOC for more information.

Commercial users of SLIM must register and pay for their copies of SLIM
within 30 days of first use, or their license is withdrawn. Site license
arrangements may be made by contacting Dominic Herity.

granted to associate members of the Association of Shareware Professionals.
