OUTPUT FILE TYPE

    Because of the differences
in function handling (i.e. footers
and footnotes) between versions of
MultiMate, this parameter defines
the type of output MultiMate
document to produce.

    The RETURN key toggles
between "MultiMate Advantage II
version 1.0" and "MultiMate
version 3.6".  Choose the version
you plan to edit and print your
documents from.

Default: MultiMate Advantage II
version 1.0
