OUTPUT DIRECTORY

    This parameter determines where
the translated files will be
stored.  To change the current
entry, you must type the name of an
existing directory and path
(including colon), and press
RETURN.

    For example, the entry:

	 C:\DOCS

will cause all translated documents
to be sent to the subdirectory
"DOCS".

Default: None (documents are stored
in the current DOS default
directory.)
