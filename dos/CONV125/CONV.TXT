MACWIND   -    Converts MacPaint format pictures to Windows Paint format. 
               Since Windows Paint stores the file with no compression, this 
               program removes all blank space from around the image.

     ENTRY FORMAT:
        MACWIND infile outfile

           infile  - Picture to be converted.
           outfile - Filename to be created.


TURBOMAC  -    Converts Digi-Pic 1 (.COM) format pictures to MacPaint format. 
               The resulting file is put in the default directory with the 
               same name as the original, except the extension is changed to 
               .MAC. The extension of .COM need not be specified in the 
               filename, the program will add the extension. Entering * is the 
               same as *.COM.

     ENTRY FORMAT:
        TURBOMAC filename

            filename - Digi-Pic 1 to be converted. May contain wild cards.


DGIMAC    -    Converts Digi-Pic 2 (.DGI) format pictures to MacPaint format. 
               The resulting file is put in the default directory with the 
               same name as the original, except the extension is changed to 
               .MAC. The extension of .DGI need not be specified in the 
               filename, the program will add the extension. Entering * is the 
               same as *.DGI. Due to the width of Digi-Pic 2 format pictures 
               (640 pixels), the image is rotated 90 degrees to fit into 
               MacPaint format (576 pixels).


     ENTRY FORMAT:
        TURBOMAC filename

            filename - Digi-Pic 2 to be converted. May contain wild cards.



WINDMAC   -    Converts Windows Paint format pictures to MacPaint format. 
               Since Windows Paint stores the file with variable sizing, the 
               program will determine if the Windows Paint file can be read in 
               normally, has to be rotated ninety degrees, or is too big to be 
               converted.

     ENTRY FORMAT:
        WINDMAC infile outfile

           infile  - Picture to be converted.
           outfile - Filename to be created.


DGIWIND   -    Converts Digi-Pic 2 (.DGI) format pictures to Windows Paint 
               format. The resulting file is put in the default directory with 
               the same name as the original, except the extension is changed 
               to .MSP. The extension of .DGI need not be specified in the 
               filename, the program will add the extension. Entering * is the 
               same as *.DGI.

     ENTRY FORMAT:
        DGIWIND  filename

            filename - Digi-Pic 2 to be converted. May contain wild cards.



TURBOPRT  -    Prints Digi-Pic 1 (.COM) format pictures, without displaying 
               them on a PC. The printer section of this program outputs 320 
               bytes per line. The extension of .COM need not be specified in 
               the filename, the program will add the extension. Entering * is 
               the same as *.COM.

     ENTRY FORMAT:
        TURBOPRT filename

            filename - Pictures to be printed. May contain wild cards.


DGIPRT    -    Prints Digi-Pic 2 format pictures, without displaying them on a 
               PC. The printer section of this program outputs 640 bytes per 
               line. The extension of .DGI need not be specified in the 
               filename, the program will add the extension. Entering * is the 
               same as *.DGI.

     ENTRY FORMAT:
        PRNDGI filename

            filename - DGI pictures to be printed. May contain wild cards.


PRINTER FORMAT -
       These programs assume an IBM Graphics printer (Epson MX-80). The 
       following is the format of the printer table inside the programs. If 
       you should need to change the printer control codes the printer 
       information is located near the end of the program. The printer 
       information is in the following format:

       'PRINTER TABLE***'              ;header
                             ;Set up - 8/72 linefeed
       1 byte                          ;Length of this print string
       15 bytes                        ;Print string to send, zero filled

                            ;Print Graphics characters
                                       ;(number depends on program)
       1 byte                          ;Length of this print string
       15 bytes                        ;Print string to send, zero filled

                             ;Reset printer to normal
       1 byte                          ;Length of this print string
       15 bytes                        ;Print string to send, zero filled
