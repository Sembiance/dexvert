Introduction
様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様

        Welcome to SAR Version 1.0.  We hope to provide you with an archival
utility that will perform both efficiently and simply.  We hope you can
utilize the high performance of SAR to improve your systems performance and
data storage capabilities.

        SAR is a simple archival utility that uses the Huffman algorithms.
It has been designed to utilize a single executable for all functionality
and has proven to be more effective than most archival utilities on the
market today.  Although SAR does not have a lot of the commands other
utilities have, it more than makes up for it in compression and ease of use.
Future releases of SAR will continually include more functionality.

        This version of SAR is in no way disabled. The only of this package
being unregistered is a in the Copyright notice.

        You may use this product without registration for 30 Days for
evaluation purposes.  If at this time you are not satisfied please remove it
from your system.

                             Introduction                                  2

                                                                INSTALLATION
様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様

SAR works best when it is located in your path.  You can put SAR in your
path by either copying it into an already existing subdirectory that is in
your path, or by copying it into its own subdirectory and putting that
subdirectory into your path.

Pathing

There are two meanings for path as used under MS-DOS.  It may refer to the
location of a file, or it may refer to the places DOS will search for a
command.

In the first instance, a path would be the directory or subdirectories that a
file is located in.  If a file named "SAR.EXE" is in a subdirectory named
"SAR" under a subdirectory named "UTILS" on your C: hard drive, it's path
would be "C:\UTILS\SAR\SAR.EXE".

In the second instance, the path is a list of places stored in your "PATH"
environment variable.  Type "PATH" <CR> at the DOS prompt and you will see
what your path is currently set at on your computer.  It usually looks
something like this:

C:\;C:\DOS;C:\UTILS;D:\SAR;

It will look different on your computer.  The path is set by a statement in
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Please refer to your DOS manual for more information.


Installing SAR On Your Hard Drive

You should have a prompt on your screen similar to:

C:\>

Place the diskette containing SAR in your floppy drive, either A: or B:.
Next, create a subdirectory on your hard drive.  This can be accomplished
by typing:

C:\>MD \SAR

Change to this subdirectory.

C:\>CD \SAR

Your DOS prompt should now look like this:

C:\SAR>

Now type the following:

If using the A drive - COPY A:*.*
If using the B drive - COPY B:*.*

The contents of this file will now be placed into the SAR subdirectory.

様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様様
                              Installation                                 3

You must now modify your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  You can edit this file with any
text editor that can load and save DOS TEXT or plain ASCII files. (As of
DOS 5.0, the EDIT command will suffice).

If you have DOS 5.0 type:

C:\>EDIT AUTOEXEC.BAT

Look for a line in the file that says something similar to:

PATH=C:\;C:\DOS;

Change this line to:
...;C:\SAR
by adding a semicolon at the end of the line and the path to the subdirectory
you have just created and installed SAR into.

The line will now look similar to this:

PATH=C:\;C:\DOS;C:\SAR

You will most likely have additional items between the C:\DOS; and C:\PKWARE.

Save the file and exit.  You will have to re-boot your computer to make the
change take effect.

After you reboot type "PATH" at the DOS prompt and press enter.  Your
machine will show the path.  Make certain that the subdirectory you installed
the SAR files in is shown in the path.

Provided you have followed all the steps above correctly, you should now be
able to verify that the installation is correct by typing "SAR" and pressing
enter.  If SAR is installed correctly you should see the following:

If you receive the message "Bad command or file name" or "Unknown command",
Something has not installed properly.  Check the location of the files you

your system since the changes were made to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

Command Reference

Command Option Guide

a - Add Files to SAR

This option allows you to add files to a SAR Archive file.  Keep in mind,
if a file of the same name already exists it will be overwritten.  When
adding files SAR creates temporary files.  Neither these files, or the
archive being created, will be added to the archive.

Adding single files

        This can be accomplshed by typing the following:

        SAR a <ARCHIVE NAME> <Filename>

        ie: SAR a test sar.exe

        The above example will compress SAR.EXE to a file named TEST.SAR.
        If you specify an extension on the archive name, that extension
        will be used.

        If all has gone well you should see the following:

Adding multiple files

        This can be accomplished by typing one of the following:

        SAR a <ARCHIVE NAME> <FILENAMES>
        or
        SAR a <ARCHIVE NAME>

        The first example will archive all files listed on the command
        line:  ie: SAR a TEST SAR.EXE SAR.DOC

        You should see somthing similar to:

          21 files

        Please note the file MAKEFILE.  You will notice that there is a
        second note about this file in this example.  This occurs when
        the file being archived does not contain an extension.  When your
        file is restored, it is still restored without the extension.

d - Deleting files from the SAR Archive

This option allows you to delete files from a SAR archive.  Please keep in
mind that once the file has been deleted from the archive, there is no way
to retrieve the file from the archive.

Deleting a single file

        This can be accomplshed by typing the following:

        SAR d <ARCHIVE NAME> <Filename>

l - Listing the contents of an archive

This option allows you to view the contents of an archive and provides you
with information on each file inside the archive.  The following is a
description of each item of information contained inside the archive.

FILENAME - The name of the file stored inside the archive.
START    - The size of the file before being compressed.
FINISH   - The size of the file after compression
Ratio    - The compression percentage of the file.
           ie: 0.570 = 1.00 - percentage compressed.  In this case the
           file is 57% of the size it was before being compressed.
CRC      - This is the CRC value of the file.
Method   - Currently there are 3 methods of compression supported.
           LH5 - The best compression possible
           LH4 - A little less than LH5.  Does not occur often.
           LH0 - SAR was not able to compress this file any further.  In this
                 case it has been stored.

        This can be accomplished by typing the following:

        SAR l <ARCHIVE NAME>

        ie: SAR l TEST

        You should see something similar to the following:

p - Printing files from within an archive

This option allows you to print files to your screen, or route them to your
printer, from with the archive.  This could be very useful when you do not
wish to fill up your system with large extracted files.

Printing a single file to your computer screen

        This can be accomplished by typing the following:

        SAR p <ARCHIVE NAME> <Filename>

        ie: SAR p TEST SAR.DOC

Printing a single file to your printer

        This can be accomplished by typing the following:

        SAR p <ARCHIVE NAME> <Filename> >PRN

        ie: SAR p TEST SAR.DOC >PRN

        PRN could also be LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4 or another
        filename

Printing multiple files to your computer screen

        This can be accomplished by typing the following:

        SAR p <ARCHIVE NAME> <Filenames>

        ie: SAR p TEST SAR.DOC MAKEFILE.

Printing multiple files to your printer

        This can be accomplished by typing the following:

        SAR p <ARCHIVE NAME> <Filenames> >PRN
        or
        SAR p <ARCHIVE NAME> *.* >PRN (can also use any other wildcard comb.)

        ie: SAR p TEST SAR.DOC MAKEFILE. >PRN
        or
        ie: SAR p TEST *.* >PRN

        PRN could also be LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4 or another
        filename.

        This could be useful if you wish to merge several files into one file.

        ** Please note, this option will not work on anything other than text
           or ASCII files.
