Last minute notes about PC-Outline:

A couple of the most recently added features of PC-Outline are as follows:

1)   NEW WAY OF SPECIFYING WHERE THE CONFIGURATION FILE IS FOR USE ON
     A HARD DISK:  Instead of using the /l=<configuration file/path
     name> as a command parameter option, you may put the command
     SET PCO=<configuration file/path name> in your autoexec.bat
     file.  PC-Outline will first look in the current directory for
     the configuration file PCO.CFG.  If it is not found there and
     there was no /l=.....  command parameter, then PC-Outline will
     try the file/path set in the environment with the dos SET
     command.  By using this feature, you can start PC-Outline from
     anywhere on your hard disk simply by pathing to the directory
     that contains PCO.EXE.  PC-Outline will do the rest of the work,
     automatically finding its configuration files.

2)   NEW /d COMMAND PARAMETER FOR CONTROLLING THE STARTING CURRENT
     DIRECTORY IN PC-Outline:  The configuration file PCO.CFG
     (created from the ADVANCED CONFIGURATION menu) can contain a
     starting directory.  If it does, then each time PC-Outline
     starts it will automatically start with that directory as the
     current directory for outline files.  If it does not contain a
     starting directory, (the entry in the ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
     menu for starting directory is blank), then PC-Outline will use
     the current DOS directory as its starting directory.  If you set
     a current directory in the above menu because you keep most of
     your outline files in one particular location, but sometimes you
     want to start up PC-Outline with a different directory, then you
     can log to the directory you want and type PCO.EXE /d.  The /d
     will tell PC-Outline to ignore the starting directory set in the
     configuration file and use the DOS current directory.

3)   PC-Outline now supports the creation of a printer substitution table
     allowing you to print graphics characters on some printers.  Note:
     Graphics characters will print exactly as seen on the screen on an
     IBM printer.  On epson printers and most other printers, however, you
     must do a little extra work to get some graphics characters to print
     correctly.

     For example, if you choose bullet numbering for your outlines, an
     epson printer will not correctly print the bullet.  To fix this,
     create an ascii file named PCOPRN$.CFG and place the following line
     in it (this file exists on the PC-Outline system disk):

     char(254)=143

     The bullet character on screen is 254 and the epson printer character
     for a bullet is 143.  This command tells PC-Outline that whenever it
     is about to print a character 254, print a 143 instead.  You can
     place as many printer substitutions as you like.  The string to
     substitute can be more than one character if desired.  For example
     you could redefine the tilde character (~) to turn boldface on (for
     an epson printer) by inserting the following line.

     char('~')=27,'E'

     This would substitute ESC G for every occurence of a tilde character.

     Note that there are two ways to insert a value, by placing a
     character in single quotes ('D') or by entering the decimal
     representation for the ascii value of the character (123).  Each
     entry must be separated by a comma.  Following are some valid
     entries:

     char(132)='a'
     char('f')='ABC',32
     char(34)=255,'abc',27,'G'

     Any line in the file that begins with a semicolon will be ignored
     (useful for inserting comments).  Lines in the substitution file may
     be no longer than 80 characters.  To continue a line on the next
     line, end the line with a plus sign.  For example:

     char('~')='ABCEFGHIJKLMNOP',+
     'QRSTUVWXYZ'

     This command would print the entire alphabet everytime the tilde
     ('~') was encountered in a file.

     PC-Outline will look for the file PCOPRN$.CFG in the same directory
     as the configuration file.  If you have not used either the
     l=<filename> command parameter or the SET PCO=<filename> command to
     specify where the configuration file is located, then PC-Outline will
     just look for PCOPRN$.CFG in the current directory.


ITEMS ADDED TO PC-Outline SINCE THE DOCUMENTATION RELEASE.
----------------------------------------------------------

ADDED IN VERSION 1.02:

1)   DE-INSTALL - While using PC-Outline in memory resident mode, you may
     deinstall it from memory by pressing Control-Backspace three times in
     a row from the main editing mode.  If there were no memory resident
     programs loaded after PC-Outline, you will recover all the memory
     that PC-Outline was allocated.  If you load any memory resident
     programs after PC-Outline, the memory PC-Outline occupied will be
     freed, but it will not be available for dos to use to run other
     programs in.

     Note:     ONLY USE THE DEINSTALL COMMAND AFTER INVOKING PC-Outline
               FROM THE DOS PROMPT AND ONLY AFTER YOU HAVE SAVED ALL OF
               YOUR OUTLINES.  YOU MUST BE IN THE MAIN EDITING MODE OF
               PC-Outline FOR THE DEINSTALL TO WORK (not the opening
               menu).

ADDED IN VERSION 1.03:

1)   The "Lose Changes" prompt now looks at all open windows.  It used to
     only look at changes in the current window.

2)   With the /K command parameter option you can force PC-Outline to take
     its keys directly from the keyboard buffer without going through
     BIOS.  This allows you to bypass keyboard enhancers.

     MAIN USE:  If you have a whole bunch of keys redefined for your word
     processor and you don't want those key definitions for PC-Outline,
     you can use the /K option and the keyboard enhancer will be active in
     your main program, but not when you invoke PC-Outline.  When you
     return back to your word processor, the keyboard enhancer will
     automatically be active again.  It is likely you will only find use
     for this option when using PC-Outline in its memory resident mode.

     For those of you following the progression of versions, all
     non-memory resident versions get their keys through BIOS.  For the
     memory resident version, 1.00 and 1.01 got keys directly from
     keyboard buffer, 1.02 got keys through BIOS and 1.03 gives you the
     choice with /K (default through BIOS).

ADDED IN VERSION 1.04:

1)   A few small changes to make 1.03 work how it was supposed to.

ADDED IN VERSION 1.05:

1)   DELETE OUTLINE ENTRY PROMPT:  The delete outline entry command now
     contains a prompt that asks you to confirm whether you really want to
     delete the entire outline family.  This was added in response to
     complaints that the ^D command was too dangerous.  You could delete
     your whole outline with a single keystroke.  If you do not want this
     prompt, then you can use the command parameter /P when first loading
     PC-Outline and the prompt will be skipped.  Note you could also
     define a macro for ^D to be ^DY (^D and then a Y to answer yes to the
     delete prompt).

2)   SNOW ON MONITORS:  The /T command parameter will fix a problem with
     snow on the screen that some monitors may have.  On some IBM color
     graphics adapters, you may see a small amount of snow on the left
     edge of the screen.  Using the /T command parameter should eliminate
     that.  The problem also occurs on some Hercules clone video cards.
     If you have the IBM monochrome adapter, an EGA card, or a COMPAQ
     card, you should not need this option.  Using the /T parameter has a
     slight disadvantage (so you should not use it unless you need it).
     With /T enabled, the on screen time and the CAPS and NUM indicators
     will only be updated whenever you press a key.  Consequently, the
     time and the shift status may not be correct if you have not pressed
     a  key for a while.  Note:  this option is not the same as video
     retrace in the ADVANCED CONFIGURATION menu.  If you see snow on the
     screen, you should first make sure that this option is set to YES.
     Only if that does not fix the problem should you use /T.  You may
     also want to use this option if you have a Hercules clone and you see
     unwanted background snow all the time.

3)   LOW INTENSITY VIDEO:  The /I command parameter will force PC-Outline
     to use low intensity video instead of high intensity video (in
     response to users with a monochrome display).

4)   SAME KEY INVOKE/DE-INVOKE:  When using PC-Outline in memory resident
     mode, the same key that you use to invoke PC-Outline (the default is
     Control-Backslash, but you can change it using KEYSET.COM) will also
     exit PC-Outline and return you back to your other application.

5)   CORRECT TIME ON COMPATIBLES:  A utility program called GOODCLK.COM is
     now included on the disk that will allow PC-Outline to correctly
     display the time on some compatibles.  To use it, just run it any
     time before loading PC-Outline (preferably in your autoexec.bat
     file).  It does not remain memory resident so you lose no memory by
     running it.  All it does is set the BIOS time to be the same as the
     DOS time.  PC-Outline gets its time from BIOS (because it is so much
     quicker), but some compatibles with clock cards (AT&T, EPSON, ...)
     set the DOS time correctly on boot up, but not the BIOS time.  You
     should not need this if you have an IBM or a COMPAQ.

6)   Pressing the ESC key after hitting the menu key ("/") will now just
     cancel the menu key instead of asking you if you want to quit
     PC-Outline.

ADDED IN VERSION 1.06:

1)   A few small changes to make the memory resident version work with
     more programs.

2)   Bug fixes in the key re-definition part of the program.

ADDED IN VERSION 1.07:

1)   Small bug fixes relating to hiding and unhiding text.

2)   New shareware policy (on the opening shareware screen).

ADDED IN VERSION 1.08:

1)   You can now set all 8 levels of numbering in the Global
     Outline Style menu.  Also fixed some problems with
     getting the numbering saved correctly to the PCO.CFG
     file.

2)   Fixed bug that occurs only when copying more than 255
     outline elements from one window to another.

3)   Fixed bug that can occur only on an 80286 machine (we
     discovered one of the incompatibilities between the
     8088 and 80286) in the following situations:

     a)   Adding text to a lower window number outline with
          more than 64k of outlines above it in higher
          window numbers.
     b)   Copying text or outline elements from a higher
          window # down to a lower window # with more than
          64k of outlines in between.

ADDED IN VERSIONS 1.08A AND 1.08B:

1)   Added direct support for Prokey and Superkey so that if you use the
     /K command parameter option, PC-Outline will detect their presence
     and use their internal functions for putting them to sleep while
     using PC-Outline instead of going directly to the keyboard buffer to
     try to accomplish the same thing.  This method is considerably more
     reliable and is compatible with the expanded keyboard buffers that
     the above products offer.  If you do not use the /K parameter,
     PC-Outline behaves exactly as before.

ADDED IN VERSION 3.24:

1)   PC-Outline now uses an external ShareWare file called "PCO.ECT".
     The file should be present in the current directory.

ADDED IN VERSION 3.25:

1)   PC-Outline did not work correctly with characters above 127.
     This has  been fixed in this version in the following areas:

        DELETE LINE
        DELETE WORD LEFT-RIGHT
        BLOCK OPERATIONS.
        WORD WRAP
        INPORT/EXPORT.


ADDED IN VERSION 3.30 & 3.31: (NOT FOR THE INTERNATIONAL VERSION)

1)   PC-Outline now supports the foriegn keyboard drivers

ADDED IN VERSION 3.32 & 3.33:

1)   Search path for shareware screen file is changed, PC-Outline now
     first searches the current directory, then tries to use the
     drive/path from the enviroment variable called "PCO".
     This means that if the command in your autoexec.bat is:

         SET PCO=C:\PCO\PCO.CFG

     then PC-Outline will first look for "PCO.ECT" in the current directory,
     and then if this failes, it will look for "C:\PCO\PCO.ECT".

2)   Export block to Lotus 123 V 2.0 now fixed.

3)   Bug relate to "E - Even Right Margins" & "R - Range Paragraph Style"
     fixed, now only the paragraphs marked by the block will be changed.

4)   (NB! ONLY VALID FOR INTERNATIONAL VERSION) a new shareware screen has been
     added, the screen now consists of several screens, with the posibility to
     print out the documentation and a registration form. For the form the user
     can select the laguage he wants, and the level he wants. The correct
     address and price will the be printed in the form.


ADDED IN VERSION 3.34:

1)   ShareWare screen file "PCO.ECT" has been updated.


Have Fun!
