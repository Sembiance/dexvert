Instructions

TurShow is a CGA/EGA/VGA compatible NAPLPS viewing program for a DOS based
machine with one of the above cards.  To view a NAPLPS frame, simply type:

TURSHOW <filename> <options>

Where <filename> is the DOS path and filename of the file you wish to
display on the screen.

<options> are one of:

-cga      Display in CGA graphics mode.
-ega      Display in EGA graphics mode.
-vga      Display in VGA graphics mode.
-cbios    Display using the BIOS interface.

TurShow will automatically detect which display you are using and use that
display's drivers to show the NAPLPS frame.  If you want to force a
different display driver, use one of the above switches.

Once the file has displayed, you may either hit the spacebar to return to
DOS or wait 20 seconds.
