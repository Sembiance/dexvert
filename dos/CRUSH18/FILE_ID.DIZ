CRUSH v1.8 - <ASP> Super-compressor for DOS.
Fed up with limited compression performance
of Stacker, PKZIP, UC2, ZOO, ARJ and LHA?
CRUSH will usually give 5%-50% improved
compression over any other DOS compression
tool, & yet allows the user to continue using
the archiver already in use. CRUSH is fast &
the ideal choice for users keen to save disk
space. Too good to be true?  No! Try it!
PocketD v4.1 compat. New: no 1000 file limit
