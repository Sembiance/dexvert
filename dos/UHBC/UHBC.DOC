 ===< About UHBC >=============================================================

  UHBC is a blocksorting compressor optimized for high compression ratios. The
  current version is still in an experimental state, but because the results
  are close to the world's best, I decided to release this program as public
  BETA version. It is still under development, so you use this program at your
  own risk. UHBC doesn't use any data filters or transformations before BWT.

  UHBC is a file-to-file-compressor, not an archiver. So it doesn't store
  name, time/date or attributes of the original file. There is no check for
  existing files and there is also no file verification after decompression.


 ===< Usage >==================================================================

  Command-line:  UHBC command infile outfile [switches..]

  Commands:  e        encode infile to outfile
             d        decode infile to outfile

  Switches: -b<size>  specify maximum block size in bytes, kilobytes (k) or
                      megabytes (m), e.g. -b16m or -b900k or -b4096
                      default: -b5m, maximum: -b128m, size is rounded to 1kb
            -m<mode>  choose second stage algorithms, default: -m2
                      -m0   RLE + direct entropy coding
                      -m1   RLE + MTF + entropy coding
                      -m2   RLE + WFC + entropy coding
                      -m3   RLE + DWFC + entropy coding
            -s        process input with second stage algorithms only (don't
                      perform BWT); input should already be processed by BWT
                      but it will work for any data
            -d        disable adaptive switching between MTF/WFC and direct
                      coding; it is faster and maybe useful for comparisons
            -c<ctxt>  choose contexts for BWT sorting, default: auto-selection
                      -cf   use following contexts
                      -cp   use preceding contexts

  Examples: UHBC e book.txt book.cmp
            UHBC d book.cmp book.txt
            UHBC e large.dat large.max -b32m -m3

  Memory requirements:
    compression       8*blocksize + 256kb
    decompression     5*blocksize
