* Continue pretty(prefix) with PREFIX for all classes

* output fileset should be empty and set root to the actual out dir then I can just add the output files

* Probably create a 'Converter.js' class (DexState, "converter string") that will handle parsing the converter string and running the programs/moving files, etc.

* Program: After running program, run fixPerms with cwd of output.root

* Program: Then find any new output files and stick in output.add("new", files)
  Will need to do a tree in output.root and subtract any already in output.main

* Program: Then run program.post() if it is set

* Program: Then if just 1 output file (output.new.length===1), rename it according to program.renameOut object.
Key defaults are { ext : ".png", name : true}
default ext is different per family. So image is .png, audio is .wav, etc
If ext is set to an untruthy value false/null/etc then it won't rename the ext
If ext is a string, it will be set to that
If name is set to false, the filename won't be renamed. If set to true (the default) the filename will be renamed to the original input name. If set to a string, the filename will be renamed to that string

* dexvert.js, now that program is done, pass the input/output filesets to family.verify()

* Family.verify:
  It will check the files in output.new and verify they are valid images/wavs/etc
  It will delete empty files, files that are the same as the input (fast hash, blake/blaze?)
  Any it decides to keep use new method FileSet.changeType("new", "main") to move from new to main
  If it does keep any, then this is what sets to dexvert.processed = true

* dexvert.js then if processed, will rsync the 'main' files back to the original output root and finish up

* Fully identify and process:
image/pcx
image/qrt
image/xwd
image/fractalImageFormat
image/degasHiPI
image/mur
image/artistByEaton
image/autoSketchDrawing
image/artworx
image/hsiRaw
image/ans
image/apStar
image/artDirector
image/advancedArtStudio
image/hiPic
archive/windowsThumbDB
archive/msCompound
archive/macBinary
text/txtByFilename
font/amigaBitmapFont

* Now convert and identify any formats with:
untrustworthy (which has been removed entirely, as programs are untrustworthy, not formats)
idCheck -> byteCheck
filesRequired/filesOptional -> auxFiles

* Now get processing working, again, starting with all the formats I've already converted, see above.
  Create a .tar file that will include symlinks outside of the dir. So have one symlink to / and another to like one dir up ../../outSideOfTar.txt
  Ensure the tar is created as symlinks and not what the symlink points to
  Then for processing make sure to check each output symlink and if it points to something outside of the top level, delete the symlink
  Also create a test/testdex.js file
  Some of the formats will likely need 'transformUnsafe = true' flag added, but won't know right away. Make sure the output of process shows whether it was on a transformed file or not
  Programs don't need preArgs() it can just be handlded in args now that it is async capable
  Programs can be marked as unsafe (such as recoil2png). Make sure that transformed files are never sent to 'unsafe' programs
  Program  flags are shorter and more generic:
	inputType
	outputType
	fps
	etc.

* Now go through every other format, and test identification and processing for each one

* Maybe convert test-identify/test-process to have a live web page or fancy console status with boxes for every format type that turn red/green on success/failure

* Once all done, go through the sandbox/wip/misIdentified files and figure out where they go, then delete the misIdentified folder
  These are files that I believe DID convert, but do not actually appear to be the image they are assigned to, so need to determine what type they actually are

* Once ALL FORMATS identifcation fully working and tested, think about adding a 'prefix' match type that will match prefixes against extensions

* Will likely need to create FileSet/DexFile/etc  static Class.parse() and class.toJSON() methods that utilize xu.parseJSON() and create objects and JSON.stringify them.

* Try this as alternative to lobe, see how it does: https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/

* To start, have all linux programs run locally, just as dexvert always has.
  Eventually though, I want to be able to just have Program.loc default change to 'gentoo' and be able to run it all on gentoo qemu by default (maybe dynamic based on hostname or environment variable)
* Create a new QEMU instance with dexvert:dexvert username that has X11 and boots up into awesomewm auto login auto start X
DON'T DELETE OLD ONE, as I need to refer to it 
Make a 10GB hd.img and a 40GB other.img that mounts as /mnt/extra then make symlinks
/usr/portage -> /mnt/extra/usr/portage
/usr/src     -> /mnt/extra/usr/src
/var/tmp     -> /mnt/extra/var/tmp
/usr/tmp     -> /mnt/extra/usr/tmp
Of course only the hd.img is used in the final version
* Use this new Gentoo QEMU instance to run all Linux conversion programs (so if they are exploited, somewhat more protected)
Will need to update the 'supervisor.sh' script AND the QEMU server JS code to support a 'supervisorid' number.
I'll want to run like 20x supervisor.sh scripts at once, since each QEMU instance can run more than 1 program at a time
Will need to increase the ram from like 2GB to 10GB (since files get copied and processed into RAM) and size cores/instance count appropriately to not use all RAM.
Will want to be able to specify the number of servers per OS type, so instead of numServers : 10 have numServers : {gentoo : 20, win2k : 10, winxp : 15, amigappc : 10}
Both the supervisor script and the 'go' script should both disable core dumps with the equilivant linux command (ulimit?): posix.setrlimit("core", {soft : 0});

* Make an apps.txt document for win2k/winxp that list the custom apps I installed, and where they are located and their version numbers and corresponding data/app/install.exe program
