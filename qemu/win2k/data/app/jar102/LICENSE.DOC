
    JAR LICENSE POLICY                                         August 1997


    The JAR archiver (JAR16 and JAR32), the encryption modules (JAR_C.COM
    and JAR_C.DLL), the REARJ program, and the associated documentation are
    copyright (c) 1990-97 ARJ Software, Inc., all rights reserved.  The JAR
    software may not be circulated in any incomplete or modified form, nor
    sold for profit, without written permission of ARJ Software, Inc.  The
    JAR software refers to the package of JAR16.EXE, JAR32.EXE, JAR_C.COM,
    JAR_C.DLL, and REARJ.EXE.  The word JAR refers to the JAR software
    unless otherwise indicated.

    If you distribute this software to others, you are required to
    distribute the ENTIRE package consisting of the following files:

    AGENTS.DOC
    CREDIT.CRD
    CONVPROT.BAT
    ERRORS.DOC
    README.DOC
    FILE_ID.DIZ
    INTRO.DOC
    JAR.CFG
    JAR.DOC
    JAR16.EXE
    JAR32.EXE
    JARBACK.BAT
    JARINCR.BAT
    JARREST.BAT
    JAR_C.COM
    JAR_C.DLL
    LICENSE.DOC
    ORDERFRM.DOC
    REARJ.CFG
    REARJ.DOC
    REARJ.EXE
    TECHNOTE.DOC
    TESTJAR.BAT
    WHATSNEW.DOC
    WHY_JAR.DOC
    SAMPLE.J

    NOTE: The export version of this distribution archive does NOT
    contain the encryption modules, JAR_C.COM and JAR_C.DLL, per USA
    export regulations.

    We strongly prefer that the files be distributed in the format
    originally released: JAR###.EXE (### = version) with the ARJ-SECURITY
    envelope as created by ARJ Software, Inc.  If you must distribute the
    JAR archive in another archive format, please archive the JAR###.EXE as
    one file inside the other archive.  Re-archival of the software as
    separate files means losing the ARJ security envelope.

    As a brief description of JAR, we suggest the following:

    "JAR is a file archiver that compresses files into a disk space saving
    archive.  It is fast, powerful, reliable, and has a rich set of
    features which include outstanding data compression, Windows 95/NT
    long filename support, file version management, data recovery
    protection, multiple volume archives (archives that span diskettes)
    and much more."

    You may NOT distribute the registered version of JAR except as noted in
    your JAR license agreement.

    The use and/or sale of the JAR software package is subject to the
    following terms:


    PERSONAL USE:

    For personal use (at home and non-commercial), JAR may be freely used
    and shared with others.  There is no REQUIRED registration fee for
    non-commercial, non-business, non-institutional, non-government
    personal use.  Instead, we ask that you share the JAR software with a
    friend.

    For personal use, the program REARJ may be freely used only by JAR
    users.  A JAR user is one who uses JAR on a regular basis. Others who
    wish to use REARJ must purchase a registration for the JAR package.

    The user who registers receives several benefits:

    * Technical support by telephone, fax, email, or mail.  You can get
      help with any questions or problems you encounter in using JAR.

    * Full access to all of the features of JAR via a registration serial
      number.

    * The use of the JAR-SECURITY envelope for data authentication.

    * The satisfaction of knowing that you are supporting the development
      of good, affordable software.


    BULLETIN BOARD SYSTEM (BBS), WEB SITE, AND FTP SITE USE:

    JAR and REARJ may be freely used on commercial and non-commercial
    electronic file distribution sites (computer bulletin board systems,
    WEB sites, FTP sites and so on) for the purpose of distributing *.J
    archive files.  The JAR shareware distribution archive (JARnnn.EXE)
    may be freely distributed by these sites.

    JAR and REARJ may be freely used on non-commercial electronic file
    distribution sites where JAR is one of the supported primary archive
    formats.  The use of JAR and/or REARJ on a BBS where JAR is not one of
    the supported primary archive formats requires a registration or site
    license.

    Support of JAR involves allowing JAR archives as uploads AND making
    JAR archives available as downloads.


    INSTITUTIONAL/COMMERCIAL INTERNAL USE LICENSE/REGISTRATION:

    Any corporation, institution, government agency or business wishing to
    use the JAR software in the course of its internal business must
    purchase an JAR registration or SITE LICENSE. Any individual wishing
    to use the JAR software within a corporation, institution, government
    agency or business must purchase an JAR registration or SITE LICENSE.
    The SITE LICENSE is provided for those who want to use JAR on multiple
    computers.  A sample INTERNAL USE LICENSE for the internal use of the
    JAR software is included at the end of this document. Please see the
    ORDERFRM.DOC or write for terms.

    Any corporation, institution, government agency or business may use
    the unregistered shareware version of JAR only for evaluation purposes
    and only for a thirty day period.  After the thirty day period, you
    must either register JAR or discontinue its use.  While you are in the
    process of registering JAR, you may continue to use the unregistered
    JAR program until you receive your registration serial number.

    This internal license does NOT license the inclusion of the JAR
    software with a hardware/software package that is distributed
    externally.

    The unlimited SINGLE LOCATION SITE LICENSE permits JAR internal use
    for an unlimited number of computers/users at one street address. This
    definition of a SINGLE LOCATION SITE is subject to change.  The
    unlimited MULTIPLE LOCATION SITE LICENSE permits JAR internal use for
    an unlimited number of computers/users at all locations.

    Each computer that uses JAR in any way requires licensing.  In
    addition, computers that are being backed up with JAR via a file server
    require licensing.  For example, if computer Z's data is copied to a
    file server and that file server uses JAR to archive Z's data, then
    computer Z needs to be licensed for JAR.

    Examples of institutional or commercial use of JAR:

    1)  Using JAR to backup your business programs and/or data.
    2)  Using JAR to create archives for storing or transporting business
        data.
    3)  Using JAR on a company supplied home computer for company
        business.
    4)  Using JAR to backup your research programs and/or data.
    5)  Using JAR on your home business computer for business purposes.

    The above examples should NOT be considered the ONLY types of
    institutional or commercial use of JAR.


    SHAREWARE DISTRIBUTION USE BY INDIVIDUALS:

    The use of JAR to create an JAR format archive (*.J) for the purpose
    of distributing shareware or freeware to computer bulletin board
    systems IS NOT considered commercial use.  However, any other use of
    JAR in connection with a shareware product is commercial use.  For
    example, using JAR to backup shareware source code is commercial use.


    DISTRIBUTION LICENSE:

    Standard JAR format archives (*.J) may be distributed without a
    license.

    Any corporation, institution, government agency or business wishing to
    include JAR16, JAR32, JAR_C.COM, or JAR_C.DLL, or REARJ as an integral
    part of a software and/or hardware package to be distributed externally
    must purchase a DISTRIBUTION LICENSE. The use of JAR on one computer to
    build the software and/or hardware package is included in the
    DISTRIBUTION LICENSE.

    The above requirement does NOT apply to those who did NOT initiate
    the inclusion of the JAR software with the software and/or hardware
    package.

    Please write for terms providing your distribution details:

    1)  Expected distribution numbers in total.
    2)  The approximate value/price of the package.
    3)  A brief description of the software/hardware.
    4)  A description of how JAR will be used in the distribution.

    If you wish to use the archiver JAR or the conversion program REARJ
    in your application software, the pricing is similar to the INTERNAL
    LICENSE price schedule.  Please write for terms.


    RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONAL USE:

    To obtain the donation of a SITE LICENSE and/or DISTRIBUTION LICENSE,
    please write providing details of your organization's religious and
    charitable activities and the intended use for JAR.  A free license
    will be provided to qualifying organizations.  Qualifications will be
    determined on a purely subjective basis.  Non-qualifying organizations
    can always obtain licenses by purchase.

    Non-religious non-profit organizations promoting causes that do not
    conflict with our personal faith and ethics may also qualify for a
    free license.


    COMMERCIAL SALE:

    Any software dealer or library may distribute the entire JAR package
    in an unmodified form for a fee as long as the price charged for the
    disk containing JAR does not exceed US $10.00.  You may NOT distribute
    any registered version of JAR.

    Any software dealer or library may distribute the entire JAR package
    in an unmodified form when included in a CD-ROM shareware collection.
    Moreover, permission is freely given for the use of the JAR software
    to view and/or install CD-ROM shareware collections where the entire
    JAR package is included.  No special license is required nor will a
    special license be granted.

    With these exceptions, the sale of JAR or its parts for profit,
    either alone or together with other software or hardware, requires a
    licensing agreement possibly providing for royalty payments.  Please
    write for terms.


    UPGRADE POLICY FOR JAR:

    Registered/licensed users of JAR may upgrade JAR to the next DOT
    release (1.1 to 1.2, etc) for a small diskette fee.  See the
    ORDERFRM.DOC for details.  UNLIMITED MULTIPLE SITE LICENSE holders
    will get unlimited free JAR upgrades.

    Current ARJ licensees who purchase JAR licenses of EQUAL or LESSER
    value get a fifty percent discount off the JAR license fee.  When
    purchasing a JAR license of greater value, ARJ licensees will get a
    fifty percent discount based upon an equivalent JAR license fee.  For
    example, if a user has a five PC ARJ license and then purchases a 15 PC
    JAR license, that user will receive a discount calculated by taking
    fifty percent of the five PC JAR license fee.  Please note that the
    licensee's ARJ license is still valid.  Please note that we consider
    the older $2000 unlimited use site license equivalent to the new $2500
    unlimited use single site license.


    JAR-SECURITY ENVELOPE USE:

    This feature is intended for but not limited to software developers
    who wish to distribute archived software with some assurance that the
    archived software in a validated JAR-SECURED archive will be secure.

    All JAR registrations include a free JAR-SECURITY envelope.

    damages.  In no event shall the liability of ARJ Software, Inc. for any
    damages ever exceed the price paid for the license to use the software,
    regardless of the form of the claim.
