* Add format: http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/RCA-VOC

* Try this CD and see if there is a 'Mac' partition that has some weird files on it (https://digipres.club/@sembiance/111342192945605623
https://archive.org/details/General_Admission_Software_Time_Out_Sports_Basketball_Win31Mac_1994_Eng

* Check sockUtil code and it's tests and ensure it's as simple and modern as can be with fully working and COMPREHENSIVE tests
  Also do a quick searchCode for sockUtil to see where I may be using it

* Run the xwork and xworkerpool tests, ensure they work.
GOAL: Make xwork/xworkerpool ROCK SOLID.
Search all my code for uses of xwork or xworkerpool.
See what features I actually use and consider simplifying my code by removing features
Double check work tests full errors and that it covers all possible failure conditions (including a low level timeout feature (at xwork level if possible))
If I decide to make more major changes, consider making a new lib with a new name

* Create a dexrecurse.js app that will take a given starting archive and recurse down into it creating a 'tree' of output
  dexrecurse.js <outputDir> <file> <file> ...
  It will create <outputDir>/file/  <outputDir>/meta/  and  <outputDir>/log/
  Each one will be a directory tree of files/JSON with files that are processed creating a <dir>ยง suffix to extract files/meta into
  Full directory tree in /log/ as well with a .txt log for each file (so it doesn't have to be loaded with the meta JSON later in retromission)
  It should also create a <outputDir>/report.html with new magics, new file samples, etc similar to what retroadmin used to do
  For new file samples, get a count of each formatid on disk (in dexvert/test/sample). Never copy more than '3' new samples. Never want more than 10 total of each type. So if existingCount[formatid]<10: needCount = Math.min(3, 10-existingCount[formatid]). b3sum existing files of course and only include 'new ones'. Group the new files ext and pick one from each ext up until we have needCount. If still need more (OR IF WE ONLY HAVE 1 EXTENSION), stick all the files into an array (removing those already gonna copy by ext) and sort the array by file size, then take the largest, smallest and one from middle.
  Group files for that formatid by ex
  Possibly the JSON generated to create report.html, also save that out was <outputDir>/report.json
  Also create in /meta/ a .json for each folder. Do this AFTER it's all done and use the meta files themselves to create summary metas with things needed for retromission to render such as sub counts, etc
  Test with CD #3 and some other early items, see how it works.
  Need to ensure it's both fault/crash tolerant and also 'a file takes forever' tolerant. On CD 3, find a file type that there is only like 1 or 2 of on the disc and for that type force a crash and see that it handles it properly. Also force it take a LONG time and ensure I have some way of killing sub-procs that take way too long (>1 hour) and either re-try (ONCE ONLY) or just give up on that file
  Possibly consider making a dexrecurse test case for CD isos so I can test new servers against them in addition to the existing test cases

* Integrate into dexvert: https://github.com/n0samu/DirectorCastRipper
  See the discord chat from nosamu with some details as to how to use it. Would be great if I could use this instead of macromedia director.
  Also SEE below the High Priority item that details this task

* Ensure all the files from these CDs convert properly with dexrecurse:
	iso/Digital Magazine for Photography - Gallery
	iso/Sexual Girls in Magical World
	iso/Natsu Nice Gal Summary '94
	iso/Love Bytes

* Ensure printEmergeList prints out full and accurate instructions to take one of my new virgin servers and bring it up to a fully working dexvert machine
  Do this with the tier.net server first, and get it fully working, then test it on gthost & serverdime

* Benchmark the test suite on tier.net/gthost/serverdime so I can get an idea on how fast various hardware performs
  Previously each dexdrone cost $359/month
  Look into other webhosting talk deals and also wenmx. re;oan;esote/met amd jove;pcoty/met

* Create a 'dexcloud' process that I can run on xeen. It has a manually registered list of hosts (dexdrone#) that I can spawn out dexrecurse jobs to
  Idea is it keeps track of which hosts are available and which are not. Goal is to have lots of very cheap intel like 48core 72core machines
  Then dexrecurse jobs (along with their files) can be sent to an API on dexcloud. It holds these on disk in a queue until a dexdrone opens up
  API consumers will poll the API to get status and find out when it's all done and result files can be downloaded
  Will need an 'dexcloud.cosmicrealms.com' admin interface that shows the status of all the drones, which are available, current processing status
  Would be nice to also see a log of recently completed items, things in queue, etc
  Since the files are copied then copied again in both directions, and on fewer core, slower machines, this will make individual ISOs slower
  But it'll be a lot cheaper and can spin up more more easily and also might be faster than before with more machines

* I have LibDsk installed and program 'dskconv' in dexvert, look at the formats it supports and add support for them:
	.DSK files, as used in CPCEMU, JOYCE and other Sinclair/Amstrad emulators.
	MYZ80 hard drive image files.
	NanoWasp floppy image files.
	.CFI (Compressed Floppy Image) files, as created by FDCOPY.COM under DOS.
	CopyQM files
	TeleDisk files
	Compaq QRST files
	APRIDISK image files
	The LDBS format

* Add program (oiiotool/iconvert) and formats it supports: https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio

* Look into adopting KeyView Pro as more conversion software: https://archive.org/details/KeyViewPro

* Macromedia Director is prone to not properly extracting all cast members due to various issues/glitches.
  I should wait for some of the options below to become more "mature" and "available" before proceeding with this task.
  Option #1: dirry: https://github.com/markhughes/dirry
	It didn't work on a test file, but it's VERY new only coming out a few days ago and it's FAQ mentions it's got problems
	Says it supports EXE files too, so that would be great and may need to be added to 'exe.js' format if I can't detect these
  Option #2: drxtract: https://github.com/System25/drxtract
	It seems to work, but the code is a bit flimsy and it likely doesn't have deep support for various bitmap formats, etc
  Option #3: SCUMMVM code: https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/tree/master/engines/director
	SCUMMVM has really good support for the various formats, but not CLI extraction tool
	It even supports EXE files too, so that would be great, it may need to be added to 'exe.js' format if I can't detect these
	So I'd have to write some C++ code that leverages the code from SCUMMVM to extract & convert the resources
	This may be a significant amount of work as the code is designed to work 'within SCUMMVM' and may needs LOTS of massaging
	https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/blob/master/engines/director/resource.cpp
	https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/blob/master/engines/director/archive.cpp
  Option #4: nosamu's Cast Ripper: https://vinizinho.net/projects/shockwave-rip
	An XTra/plugin for Director that allows you to extract resources from within Director.
	The author mentioned on Discord that an updated version that works via command line may be "in the works"
  Option #5: tomysshadow extractor: https://github.com/tomysshadow
	Was told that tomysshadow is also working on an extractor too, with potential additional Xtras support
  Whatever method I go with, ensure it handles Macintosh Roman text better:
    https://archive.org/details/cd-rom-now-n-21   /director/stones.dir/00025_Field_25.txt
  Would love it if it supported older Director files such as: sample/archive/macromediaDirector/Pickle'sPocket
  Also sample/archive/macromediaDirector/The\ Tower DEMO  (which is a MacBinary file, may need to 'unar' into bin/rsrc first, maybe not)
  It's possible that video/riffMultimediaMovie is actually a Director 3 Mac file already supported by ScummVM: https://discord.com/channels/350407629849493504/1033065501984817252/1038536366818086963

* Softdisk GS Apple 2GS files have Icon files that have embedded icons. This program can view them: https://github.com/dmolony/DiskBrowser/blob/master/src/com/bytezone/diskbrowser/applefile/IconFile.java
  Doesn't look too complicated a format, could potentially convert the icons or maybe could get deark to add support for them

* When DiscMaster was around, encountered several BitRock installers with this search: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=BitRock+Installer&qfields=content&formatid=xml
  These may be able to be extracted using: https://gist.github.com/mickael9/0b902da7c13207d1b86e

* Add support music/fuxoftAYLanguage and music/ayAMAD
  Ay_Emul can play both these, but it doesn't have CLI conversion supportso I could do either:
  1. Add CLI conversion support tp Ay_Emul (see email about building it from svbulba@gmail.com)
  2. Patch ZXtune (which uses Ay_Emul) to support these formats
     If I do ZXTune, submit patch here: https://bitbucket.org/zxtune/zxtune/issues/150/ay-amad-support
     In EITHER CASE, make sure I'm using the latest versions of both the above before trying

* ISOs I was unable to process:
	No idea what format this is in: https://archive.org/details/Royal_Tyrrell_Museum_Virtual_Tour_2003_WIN98
	These don't convert for some reason, they both appear to be Mac CDs
		https://archive.org/details/800_jeux_pour_mac		This one has an extra 16 bytes at front, removing it doesn't fix it, but did allow UniExtract to extract a TOAST partition, but couldn't process that at all either
		https://archive.org/details/Lex-C-RomSharewareExpress	no idea on this one
	Raw mac partition dumps:
		https://archive.org/details/apple-r-p-lib-internal-v-1.0
		https://archive.org/details/apple-r-p-lib-internal-v-2.0
		https://archive.org/details/apple-r-p-lib-reseller-v-1.0_202007

* See if I can detect and extract the compressed files in sandbox/fail/unsupportedCompression/*
  Maybe something from: https://www.sac.sk/files.php?d=7&l=

* Take this 'xv' program that runs in Linux and make a CLI tool that leverages it's support of formats to convert to PNG
  https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/xv
  Specifically I want to convert image/yanagisawaPIC2 into PNG with: https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/xv/-/blob/master/xvpic2.c

* Get the IFF-RGFX datatype installed and working in vamos: http://aminet.net/package/util/dtype/RGFX-DT or http://aminet.net/package/util/dtype/RGFX-DT35
  Once it can view pictures, see about how I can convert into PNG, maybe with: https://aminet.net/package/gfx/conv/gfxcon
  Also see if I can add IFF YAFA support
  If either of the above fails, then add below to Low Priorty: Code my own image converter for IFF RGFX and IFF YAFA that leverages ancient to do unpacking of the data. See deark issues for more details.

* Add POVRAY rendering support, see the notes in povRay.js
  Example files: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/15720/Disk18.iso/ZIPS/POV@.EXE/POV
  Other POV files: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=pov&qfields=ext&family=text&dedup=dedup

* InstallShield cab extraction can be problematic as unshield doesn't work correctly with everything.
  For example CABS from: https://archive.org/details/250TCF
  They take up 653MB of space but only 62MB is extracted.
  Possible options: https://community.flexera.com/t5/InstallShield-Knowledge-Base/Installshield-Setup-exe-Command-Line-Parameters/ta-p/4270
  Or maybe try installing Install Shield authoring itself to see if I can open them or build an extractor or something:
	https://archive.org/details/install-shield-6.2-pro-std.-7z
	https://archive.org/details/installshield1150premier

* Get AARU support working: https://github.com/aaru-dps/Aaru
  https://archive.org/details/cd32-gamer-volume-11-1xcd		/Disc Dump/CD32_11.aaruf
  https://archive.org/details/cd32gamervolume91xcd			/Disc Dump/CD32Gamer9.dicf
  Then add that converter as an option to all formats that it supports

* Now that Print to File/PDF works better, should now be able to support:
  document/greenstreetPublisher (Open in win2k (or winxp) with Publishing Suite 99)

* Now that I emulate a real sound card with 86Box, I may be able to support music/famiTracker in winxp. See note

* Decide how I'm gonna share dexvert with the world:
  - Could see if I can now get it working within a QEMU/VMWare/VirtualBox image, now that I don't run QEMU anymore within dexvert
    Could maybe then package this image into a docker image for even easier use.
  - Could create a hard disk image that is capable of being 'spun' up in cloud instance like amazon/gcp/azure
  - Could use amazon/gcp/azure or baremetal servers and provide some sort of remote authenticated 'cloud' service.

* Now that wine works and thus .NET and other vista/win7 programs work, try incorporating these programs into dexvert:
	reaConverter 7		https://www.reaconverter.com/		(see sandbox/app/reaConverter_formats.txt for format list. image/zbr can be converted to SVG with reaConverter)
	music/masterTracksPro: Using sandbox/app/master_tracks_pro_full.exe and S/N in email, could convert these to MIDI
	image/xRes: Using sandbox/app/xRes 3.0.iso
	*.DAX: Forgotten Realms Gold Box. "Gold Box Explorer" (sandbox/app/gbexplorer-1.2.zip) code from here: https://github.com/simeonpilgrim/goldboxexplorer	http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=dax&qfields=ext&family=unknown&sortBy=itemid
	Japanese Visual Novels: A variety of archive formats, many supported by this program: https://github.com/morkt/GARbro    Then reprocess: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/1123
	Stuffit Expander for Stuffit-X files might work in 64bit Vista? http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=sitx&qfields=ext&formatid=unknown
	SGS.DAT: Main DAT file from the Hyper Animation games. See sandbox/apps/DecomposeSGS		http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=sgs.dat&family=unknown

* Add OS/2 support by either using OS/2 Warp 4.5.2 (winworld) on 86Box or by using ArcaOS (was blue lion) in vbox/vmware: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utse8P_L8k0
  Then add format support for:
	archive/os2FTCOMP
	archive/os2InstallPackage
	archive/iconHeaven
	image/pmDraw
	document/os2Help	(https://hobbes.nmsu.edu/?path=%2Fpub%2Fos2%2Futil%2Fconvert)

* Add OS X support, running under tomsething like vbox/vmware.
  Then add programs:
	Graphic Converter (https://www.lemkesoft.de/en/products/graphicconverter/key-features/import-and-export-formats
	First test on my real mac to see if I can convert files via CLI (check PCX, AOL Art, etc) (see Help->CLI Commands)
	If CLI works then try getting it working in a virtual machine of some sort, something more portable than QEMU
	To run the supervisor.sh script on boot: https://www.karltarvas.com/2020/09/11/macos-run-script-on-startup.html
  Add format support:
	archive/sparseImage

* Add Classic MacOS support so the following can be supported:
	These seem to be Disk Copy 5/6, which I may be able to extract/convert with: http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/disk-copy-6
	  https://archive.org/details/GigaROM2.0.img
	  https://archive.org/details/InfoMac5Disk1.img
	  https://archive.org/details/InfoMac5Disk2.img

* Add RISC OS support, with one of these emulators:
	https://www.marutan.net/rpcemu/index.php
	http://arcem.sourceforge.net/
	http://b-em.bbcmicro.com/arculator/
	http://www.virtualacorn.co.uk/product.htm  (only runs on Windows)
	http://www.riscos.com/shop/products/106/index.htm  
  Will want to find CineWorks application and probably stick to version 3.x of RiscOS: https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/5/topics/248?page=2
  Then add support for:
	unsupported/audio/audioWorksSoundSample
	video/acornReplayVideo
  More samples from:
	https://archive.org/details/cine-clips
	https://archive.org/details/acorn_replay_collection
	https://archive.org/details/cdrom-riscos-clipart
	https://archive.org/details/cdrom-riscos-risc-disc-1

* Add DOS printing support to DOSBox with a patch from: https://sourceforge.net/p/dosbox/patches/?limit=250
  Once I have that I could support certain formats like:
	document/dartHypertext
	document/envisionPublisherDoc
	document/ibmStoryboardDocument

* Add Old 32bit Linux support then add (see notes for each format):
  music/beRoTracker
  music/synderSNG

* Create dexvert.com with a 'Browse' button that allows you to upload files to convert.
  Bonus points if I make a quick dirty 'dexvert.sh' bash script that folks can use that will convert via wget from CLI via dexvert.com
  WARNING! I need to assume that it will be exploited since I run so many programs, many of which likely have exploits.
  So I will want to research how to run programs within some sort of jailbreak, or leverage the docker image with multiple instances

* Add rendering of previews of full game maps supported by 'gamemap': https://github.com/Malvineous/libgamemaps
  Research them here: https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net

* Add 3D/Poly support. Can convert everything to GLTF/GLB format and use this viewer on the website: https://modelviewer.dev/
  Or use X3D instead?  https://cadexchanger.com/blog/3d-formats-overview-vrml-and-x3d/
  3DS is 3DS Max, so use that to convert things like: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/1268/Graphics%20Plus.iso/media/objects/3ds/ve_space/romulan.zip
  Software to convert DXF (and others) to GLB: https://github.com/assimp/assimp
  Other software that works with GLB: https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Project-Explorer/

  Converting Shockwave 3D files: https://github.com/tomysshadow/Shockwave-3D-World-Converter
  https://cadexchanger.com/contact-us/licensing-inquiry/#requestFormSection
- Over 8,000 lightWave3DScenes that have not been properly identified yet : http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=LWSC&qfields=content&family=text&formatid=txt
- For THUMBNAILS of polys, just a PNG screenshot, but with a line/globe/3d model looking icon in the bottom right corner of the thumbnail
- Ray Dream Studio 5.5 works ok on Windows XP and loaded some sample RDS files I tried: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/16286/Ray%20Dream%20Studio%205.5%20(MetaCreations)(1999).iso/pc
  It has multiple export options. Make sure files get the .rds extension, without it they wouldn't open (http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/16284/Ray%20Dream%20Studio%20(CDRAYD1)%20(Ray%20Dream)%20(1995).iso/Dream%20Models/Lifeform/PENGUIN)
- Add support for VRML. Possible renderers: https://github.com/castle-engine/view3dscene, Blender, Blaxxun Contact 4.4
  Would love have it be interactive in the browser. See the 3D/Poly support note below:
- Would be great if on the 'browse' page each model could be viewed inline in a small thumbnail sized interactive viewer. Though this may be too intensive? Maybe generate thumbs for each one, as we do for images and show the thumbs instead
  For a Before/After screenshot, can use search results: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=3dmf&itemid=9374
- Then use this doom2vrml program to make doom levels browseable: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/6095/WIN95_09962.iso/vrml/dm2v-10.zip  or  http://www.ocnus.com/doom.html
  Then reply to tweet: https://twitter.com/senn_twt/status/1591342713739288576?s=12&t=Y840vTjzTkojj8W_7FWPNw
- Would be amazing if other levels (Hexen, Heretic, Unreal, Wolfenstein 3D, Quake, etc) were flyable too
- Would also be cool if it could convert and render entire levels liek Warcraft maps, warcraft 3 maps, doom, hexen, quake and valve maps, etc
- poly/rayDreamDesignerScene openable in Corel Draw 7?
- Add support for this 3D format: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/2020/The%20640%20Meg%20Shareware%20Studio%20CD-ROM%20Volume%20II%20(Data%20Exo)(1993).ISO/graphics/3d25.zip

* Pay someone to add more formats to FFMPEG (gl/dl/ANIM/etc) or to improve existing formats: http://www.ffmpeg.org/consulting.html

/----------------\
| Probably Never |
\----------------/
* Consider switching away from DOSBOX and use an authentic MS-DOS installation under 86Box
   Pro: Compatability with some dexvert/dos/* programs that didn't work under dosbox (of which I don't know of any). Feels cleaner.
  Cons: Would need to solve video recording & keyboard control (both of which I wrote custom code patches to DOSBOX to implement)
  I could maybe add similar code to 86Box, but that would be harder to control from 'within' dos.
  It's probably not worth doing since I can't think of many 'benefits' and what I have with DOSBox "works ok"

* Add 3DO support. Ideally via mount using dexvert/sandbox/app/operafs but I'd need to update that code to compile against modern linux kernel
  Other 3DO extractor programs: https://forum.uqm.stack.nl/index.php?topic=3535.0
  Some additional OperaFS programs: http://altmer.arts-union.ru/3DO/3do_utils.htm

* Try and get support added to linux kernel for mounting CDI images. Seems like a tall order.
  Could ask on IRC OFTC #kernelnewbies and ##linux on freenode about where I could find someone who could do this, and maybe pay them to do it
  https://www.isobuster.com/help/cd-i_and_vcd
  https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Green+Book+CD-ROM
  https://www.lscdweb.com/data/downloadables/2/8/cdi_may94_r2.pdf
  See some tools in sandbox/app/CD-i Image Decoding Tools rhdn.zip

* Create native C nodejs module for imagemagick/recoil and other libs (abydos, etc) for speed. Example existing image magick one: https://github.com/elad/node-imagemagick-native

* Convert bitmap fonts to more usable vector fonts by trying to "autotrace" the fonts, or utilize a pro tool like: https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/bitfonter/   or   https://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/transtype/
