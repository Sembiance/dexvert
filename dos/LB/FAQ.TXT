Frequently Asked Questions for version 1.57
-------------------------------------------

Q: (DOS version) When it try to play file onto my blaster/speaker etc ...
   program just show equalizer on blue background and then hang.
A: The problem might be in your mouse driver. Try -k option
   within command line or try another mouse driver. I know that player
   will hang quite nicely with Microsoft Mouse Driver v 8.20 and
   may be with some other drivers.

Q: Where can I download sound samples in .lb format ?
A: See lbplay home page: http://www.inp.nsk.su/~shmunk/.

Q: (DOS version) Why lbplay can't play onto my internal speaker
   or plays with a lot of noise or program just hangs ?
A: If you want gat most clear sound from your speaker you
   must boot as clean as possible: no multitaskers such as Windows,
   no EMM386, so that your machine stays in Real Mode.
   On some machines (mostly Pentium mother boards) LBplay can't
   produce sound to internal speaker :-(

Q: Sound comes from my speakers uncontinuously.
A: Try lower output rates (-r# for DOS version, options dialog in Win95/NT)
   or downmix to mono (-m for DOS).

Q: I still have some questions.
A: Feel free to contact:
