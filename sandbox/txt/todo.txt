* Add format: http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Dexxa_TIFF

* Add programs:
  http://xine.sourceforge.net/features
  https://pandoc.org/
  https://www.macdisk.com/conven.php
  https://tomseditor.com/ (Tom's viewer with plugins (site may be  offline https://web.archive.org/web/20220411123456/)) Archive org seems to have captured the installer, but just in case it doesn't work a potentially older version is here: https://m.majorgeeks.com/files/details/toms_viewer.html

* Investigate adding a new identification program: https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried

* Add Graphic Converter (https://www.lemkesoft.de/en/products/graphicconverter/key-features/import-and-export-formats) to my Mac Mini OSX and test CLI to convert PCX (see Help->CLI Commands)
  If that works, for QEMU OSX: https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM or https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM or https://www.emaculation.com/doku.php/ppc-osx-on-qemu-for-windows
  For the OpenBoo.sh script, just reference that and run my own command line script. See the qemu.txt doc for a link to update CLI args
  To run the supervisor.sh script on boot: https://www.karltarvas.com/2020/09/11/macos-run-script-on-startup.html

* Add to various programs that can be used in multiple families: bruteFlags : { image : { outType : ".png" } }
  Then update the dexbrute program to check ALL programs, and include those in the folder (default family) and any that have a family specified in a bruteFlags property and make sure to use those flags (like deark for archives, ffmpeg for images, soffice for images, etc)

* Code my own image converter for IFF RGFX and IFF YAFA that leverages ancient to do unpacking of the data

* If deark adds better IFF IMAG support, re-process: 265 301 313 356 357 406 481 510 517 518 519 520 607 614 615 629 731 732 766 790 921 969

* Find a converter/decompiler for applesoft BASIC. Maybe I can use: https://github.com/AppleCommander/AppleCommander/search?q=Applesoft


/-----------------\
| Medium Priority |
\-----------------/
* Add OS/2 support by using ArcaOS (was blue lion) in QEMU: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utse8P_L8k0
  Then add format support for:
	archive/os2FTCOMP
	archive/os2InstallPackage
	archive/iconHeaven
	image/pmDraw
	document/os2Help	(https://hobbes.nmsu.edu/?path=%2Fpub%2Fos2%2Futil%2Fconvert)
	and others (see unsupported notes). Then re-process any CD's that have those formats on them (#570, etc)

* Consider updating IsoBuster to 4.9 (or later if new version available) (WARNING! BACKUP hd.img FIRST, just in case this doesn't work out!): https://www.isobuster.com/news/isobuster_4.9_release_notes

* The program 'Master Tracks Pro' (to support music/masterTracksPro of which I forgot to add sample files) only works in Vista or later.
  I could create another VMWare image with Vista and use it to run it, but seems like overkill for just 1 program for 1 format.
  If I choose to do this, the app is in sandbox/app/master_tracks_pro_full.exe and S/N is in email.

* Add 3DO support. Ideally via mount using dexvert/sandbox/app/operafs but I'd need to update that code to compile against modern linux kernel
  Some additional OperaFS programs: http://altmer.arts-union.ru/3DO/3do_utils.htm

* Create a deno based parser that can parse internet e-mail/news formats to verify that they are indeed valid files
  http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Internet_e-mail_message_format
  See samples in: sandbox/samples/mail_news/

* Add support for Acorn Replay videos (#625 CineClips)
  Will want to find CineWorks application and probably stick to version 3.x of RiscOS: https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/5/topics/248?page=2
  Couldn't determine any support for QEMU (might have some though) but a fallback emulator, I'd have to run under windows 2k: http://www.riscos.com/shop/products/106/index.htm  

* GoADF 4.0 will add support for mounting an ADF file via an arexx port. Add this to adfOFS and adfFFS when added: http://www.bitplan.pl/goadf/download.html

* Figure out why this "eats" my input: test/testdexvert.js --format=music/sid

* Add sparseimage conversion support (requires MacOS X qemu, see archive/sparseImage notes)

* Add better hypercard support. Right now stackimport segfaults on almost every stack and only extracts some of the files
  Write my own deno based extractor based on the format specs: https://github.com/PierreLorenzi/HyperCardPreview/blob/master/StackFormat.md
  Reference of course stackimport and HyperCardPreview code as needed to see how to handle any particular conversion

* document/wildcatWCX files often fails to convert when running tests, try and reproduce so I can figure out why

* Could add printer support to DOSBox: https://sourceforge.net/p/dosbox/patches/?limit=250
  Then I could 'print' certain things, like EnvisionPublisher documents (look for others)

* Add 3D/Poly support. Can convert everything to GLTF/GLB format and use this viewer on the website: https://modelviewer.dev/
  Software to convert DXF (and others) to GLB: https://github.com/assimp/assimp
  Other software that works with GLB: https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Project-Explorer/

* Improve ILBM animations. Probably need to use an amiga program under QEMU and export as either GIF or raw PNG frames
  Abydos author mentioned he would like to improve the animations
  PPaint can save as animated GIF, but dunno if it handles color cycling: http://www.ppaint.com/
  Maybe also check out Delxue Paint itself to see if it has any export capability: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluxe_Paint

* Support ANSI Music files: http://artscene.textfiles.com/ansimusic/

* Add support for iffCTLG. Looks pretty easy to reverse engineer.
  Use this tool, looks fun to use: http://kaitai.io/  (or just use 010 Editor templates, see dexvert/010_templates/)
  As that tool looks like I can take the result and use it directly within dexvert. Woot.
  For inspiration help: http://formats.kaitai.io/riff/index.html

* Could improve PICT support by pieceing back together certain multi-images. For example pict/5_clamsh.ell bbq 2kangaro.o all extract multiple images that stack on top of each other to produce the final image
  Running deark with the '-d' option you can get the 'dstRect' info (https://github.com/jsummers/deark/issues/41#issuecomment-1032667777)
  I could then use imagemagick (or something else) to piece together the proper image
  After this is added, re-process CDs on retromission: 512 535

* Get other formats reverse engineered
  Goal: Produce open source code (any language) that can run on Linux that can take an input file and produce one or more output PNG files
  Could also try posting on reddit r/ReverseEngineering/ or r/INAT
  Maybe offer a $5,000 bounty on one of the sites linked: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_bounty
  Alternatively I can post on reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering  also ask where else I might post such an offer

* Ask on IRC OFTC #kernelnewbies and ##linux on freenode about PAYING someone to add support to linux kernel for mounting CDI images:

  https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Green+Book+CD-ROM
  https://www.lscdweb.com/data/downloadables/2/8/cdi_may94_r2.pdf
  See smoe tools in sandbox/app/CD-i Image Decoding Tools rhdn.zip

* Create dexvert.com with a 'Browse' button that allows you to upload files including a REST API
  WARNING! I need to assumed that it will be exploited. So I will want to run dexvert on virtual machines. Not sure if I can run virtual machines like windows from WITHIN a virtual machine running gentoo+dexvert.... hrm...


/----------------\
| Probably Never |
\----------------/
* Create native C nodejs module for imagemagick/recoil and other libs (abydos, etc) for speed. Example existing image magick one: https://github.com/elad/node-imagemagick-native

* Create a 'dexvert-remote' NPM  package that will provide the same 'dexvert inputFilePath outputDirPath' command line tool but it will upload the file to the website and then download the results all seamlessly (with progress bar)

* Convert bitmap fonts to more usable vector fonts by trying to "autotrace" the fonts, or utilize a pro tool like: https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/bitfonter/   or   https://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/transtype/
