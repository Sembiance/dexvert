       REARJ version 2.25 release

    *********************************************************************

    REARJ originally was been designed to provide conversion to the ARJ
    format.  However, it may be used to convert into the JAR format, too.
    In this package, the REARJ.CFG file is modified to convert into the
    JAR format by default using the DOS archiver version.

    REARJ does not support long filenames.

    *********************************************************************


    INTRODUCTION:

    REARJ is an archive conversion program designed to facilitate the
    conversion between LZH, ZIP, PAK, ARC, DWC, HYP, LZS, ZOO, ARJ, JAR
    archives.


    MAJOR FEATURES:

    Supports all major archiver programs (PAK, LHARC, PKZIP, ZOO, ARJ,
    PKPAK, DWC, HYPER, LARC, LHA, JAR).

    Supports file attributes within archives.

    Supports directories within archives.

    Supports converting archives within archives (ZIPs in a ZIP).

    Ensures reliable archive conversion with a file count and total size
    check.

    Supports the use of virus checkers and BBS ad removers.

    Supports recursive scanning through subdirectories.

    Optional logging of conversions.


    ********************
    * WORDS OF CAUTION:*
    ********************

    If you plan to convert many archives at one time, it is STRONGLY
    suggested that you make a backup of your hard disk.  This is a wise
    precaution to take any time that you make major modifications to data
    on your hard disk drive.

    The standard REARJ conversion DOES NOT convert any archive comments
    and volume labels.  They will be lost.

    Some of the other archivers have significant bugs which can cause data
    loss that REARJ cannot detect.  It is not the purpose of this document
    to point out other program's shortcomings.  I suggest logging the
    conversion output to a printer to facilitate checking for errors.

    If the archives you are converting will ONLY extract to absolute
    paths, you must use the /w option to set the working directory to an
    empty root directory such as a RAMDRIVE.  This will allow extraction
    to the root.

    REARJ and the archiver executables must be located in the DOS PATH
    directories.  This is due to REARJ creating and using a temporary
    directory.

    If you have changed the MS-DOS switch character from "/" to another
    character via an undocumented MS-DOS interrupt or the TurboC
    setswitchar() function, REARJ may not work properly with the default
    REARJ.CFG configuration file.

    The most thorough testing was done with ARJ as the target format and
    ZIP as the original format.  In any case, you should verify that the
    extract commands of your favorite archive formats in the configuration
    file are correct.  The extract commands are the most important to get
    right because REARJ has a built-in verification procedure to ensure
    that the ADD commands executed properly.

    You should NOT set the "-t1" option for ARJ in ARJ_SW or in the
    REARJ.CFG configuration file.  This may cause file size mismatches.

    Be sure you have enough disk space on your working directory to
    extract the largest archive that you want to convert!!!


    The versions of archivers tested:

    ARJ   1.00, 1.10, 2.00, 2.10, 2.20, 2.21, 2.30, 2.41a, current release
    LHA   2.12, 2.13
    PAK   2.51
    PKZIP 1.10
    PKPAK 3.61
    ZOO   2.01, 2.10
    DWC   A5.01
    LARC  3.33
    HYPER 2.5
    JAR   1.02


    INSTALLATION:

    Copy REARJ.EXE and REARJ.CFG to one of the DOS PATH directories.  They
    do not have to be placed in the same directory.  The PATH directories
    are usually set by the PATH command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  At
    this version of REARJ, changing its name to something else will cause
    operation difficulties.

    Be sure the archiver programs (ARJ, PAK, PKZIP, PKUNZIP, etc.) and
    virus scanner are installed in a DOS PATH directory!  It is STRONGLY
    recommended that the REARJ.CFG be modified to use FULL PATHNAMES to
    specify all archiver executables.

    This version assumes that you have the new SCAN version 80 and use
    the new option /sub to scan subdirectories.  This version's
    configuration file also assumes that SCAN.EXE is installed in
    the directory C:\BIN.


    OPERATION OF REARJ:

    REARJ will build a temporary directory in the current directory and
    extract the archive(s) to this directory.  REARJ will then build the
    target archive(s) with the files in this directory.  If the target
    archiver does not support reading of hidden or system files, REARJ
    will reset those bits and then re-archive the files without those
    attributes.  If the original archive has directories in it, REARJ will
    extract it with full paths and re-archive it with full paths if the
    target archiver supports directories.  In this case, if the archiver
    does not support directories, REARJ will skip converting this archive.

    If the "/a" option has been selected, REARJ will execute REARJ to
    convert any internal archives of the same type to the target format.
    Any "/s" option will be carried over to the recursive REARJ command.

    As an extra test, REARJ will count the files extracted from the
    original archive and total their sizes.  Then REARJ will extract the
    new archive and count the files and total the sizes.  If the count and
    size do not match, REARJ will skip converting the archive.

    REARJ assumes that the supported archivers will pass a non-zero error
    code when there is an operation failure.


    COMMAND SYNTAX:

    REARJ [switch options] filespec(s) or wildspec(s)

    You can specify one or more filespecs on the command line.  These
    filespecs can have paths and wildcards.  Up to 100 filespecs can be
    accepted by REARJ.  If you specify *.* as a wildspec, REARJ will look
    at all filenames, but will skip those filenames not ending in standard
    archive suffixes.  If you specify the /r switch, REARJ will look for
    filenames matching the filespec(s) in the current directory and all
    subdirectories of the current directory.

    The switch options and filespecs can be entered in any order.  REARJ
    uses the default MS-DOS switch character "/".  REARJ uses the Turbo
    C++ function getswitchar() to determine the MS-DOS switch character.
    If the switch character is "-", REARJ will translate any UNIX style
    pathnames to MS-DOS syntax ("dir/file" to "dir\file").


    SWITCH OPTIONS:

    /a - convert archives within archives

         This option causes REARJ to recursively execute REARJ to convert
         any archives of the original type found within the original
         archive (ex. ZIPs within a ZIP).  This option requires additional
         memory to execute successfully.

         You may specify the type of internal archive to convert with the
         "/a" option.

         Examples:  REARJ *.zip /aLZH  convert only internal LZH archives.
                    REARJ *.zip /a*    convert any internal archive.

         If you use the "/a*" option, you may need to also specify "/u"
         because of nested archives of the target type.

    /b - execute command before extracting files

         This option is used to specify a DOS command to be executed before
         extracting the original archive.

         In addition, REARJ passes the name of the original archive to
         this command as a command line argument when executing it.  This
         may cause a problem with DOS commands that expect no arguments.
         A workaround would be to install the DOS command in a batch file.


         This feature is to allow the user to prep the environment before
         extracting the archive.  This can be used to prep for archive
         comments or volume labels, etc.

    /c - execute command on extracted files before counting them

         This option is used to specify a DOS command to be executed upon
         the extracted files before REARJ counts them for later
         verification.  This is to allow executing a DOS or batch command
         to clean up the extracted files (remove BBS advertisements, etc).
         REARJ does not check for any returned error code from the
         executed command.

         In addition, REARJ passes the name of the original archive to
         this command as a command line argument when executing it.  This
         may cause a problem with DOS commands that expect no arguments.
         A workaround would be to install the DOS command in a batch file.

    /d - delete the original archive

         This option causes REARJ to delete the original archive after a
         successful conversion to the target format.  This option will NOT
         delete read-only archives.

    /e - do not return error if no archives were found

         This option is used by the internal recursive REARJ.  This option
         will cause REARJ to return a zero exit code if no matching
         archives were found.  Usually, REARJ returns a non-zero exit
         code for this condition.

    /f - convert diskette archives

         This option is used to facilitate the conversion of archives on a
         diskette.  If you do not have sufficient space on the diskette to
         keep the original archives, you MUST specify the "/d" option as
         in "REARJ A:*.zip /f /d".

         This option causes REARJ to build the target archive in the
         CURRENT directory (not the working temporary directory).  After
         verification, REARJ will, if specified, delete the original
         archive and then copy the new archive to the diskette.  You
         should make sure that the current directory does not contain any
         archives before executing REARJ.

    /i - check program integrity

         This option causes REARJ to validate the REARJ program on disk.
         If you are using a pre-3.0 MS-DOS revision, you will have to
         specify the full program name as in "REARJ /i\util\rearj.exe".

    /l - write conversion data to log file

         This option causes REARJ to open a log file and record each
         successful conversion in the log file.  The default log filename
         is REARJ.LOG.  You can specify the log filename as in
         "REARJ /lfilename *.ZIP".  If the log file already exists, REARJ
         will append logging data to it.

    /o - overwrite existing target archive

         This switch is used to delete already existing target archives.
         This is not used for updating archives.  Use the /u option for
         updating an archive.

    /q - query for each archive to convert

         This switch causes REARJ to pause and prompt the user for
         permission to convert individual archives.  Note that REARJ will
         not prompt when skipping archives.

    /r - recurse through subdirectories

         This switch causes REARJ to look for archives in all included
         subdirectories as well as in the current directory.  This switch
         allows the user to convert all archives on a hard disk with one
         command.

    /s - skip verify of file count and total size

         Skip the overhead of the file count and total size verification
         process.  This verification costs an extra extraction, but this
         check is worth the time, especially when converting a large
         number of archives.

    /t - specify the target archive type

         The default target archive format is normally JAR.  This can be
         changed by building an external REARJ.CFG file.  The first
         archive type is always the default format.  To override the
         default format, the user can specify the /t switch as in
         "REARJ *.ZIP /tlzh".  The previous example has specified that LZH
         is the target format.

    /u - allow update of archive with backup

         This switch is used to re-archive an archive, possibly to take
         advantage of improved compression.  The original archive is
         backed up by renaming it with the backup suffix which by default
         is "BAK".  You may specify another backup suffix with the /u
         option as in "REARJ *.ARJ /uar$" where the backup suffix is
         "ar$".  Since this option creates a brand new archive, archive
         comments will be lost.  Do NOT specify a "." in the suffix.

    /v - execute configured command on extracted files

         This switch is used to execute a configure command on the files
         extracted from the original archive.  The intent is to allow
         virus scanning of the archive contents.  The command must be
         specified in the REARJ.CFG file.

         The command may be placed in the REARJ.CFG file by inserting one
         line ahead of the archive commands.  The line must start with the
         word "VIRUS" followed by a blank and the external command.

         Example:  VIRUS scan /nomem *.*

         If the invoked command returns a non-zero error code, REARJ will
         skip the conversion of that archive and log the error as code 13.

         REARJ *.* /v

    /w - set working directory

         By default, REARJ creates a temporary working directory in the
         current directory.  This option allows you to specify the working
         directory.  The working directory must be EMPTY when invoking
         REARJ.  This directory is used to hold the extracted files.
         This is NOT considered the current directory for /f use.

         Example:  REARJ *.* /wd:\

         This option helps solve the absolute pathname extraction problem
         that some archivers have.  If you set the working directory to an
         empty root directory, the archiver can extract to the root and
         REARJ will be able to find all of the files to re-archive them.
         However, this option will NOT work for internal archives that
         extract to absolute paths.

    /x - exclude filenames or wildnames from the conversion process

         You can exclude one or more files from the conversion process.
         The filenames can contain wildcards.

         REARJ *.ZIP /xONE.ZIP /xTWO.ZIP

    /z - simulate conversion process

         This switch causes REARJ to simulate the conversion process.  No
         archives will be extracted, built, or deleted.


    EXAMPLES:

    REARJ *.ZIP             this converts all ZIP files in the current
                            directory to JAR files.

    REARJ *.ZIP *.ARC       this converts ZIP and ARC files to JAR
                            files.

    REARJ SOFT.ZIP          this converts only SOFT.ZIP to SOFT.J.

    REARJ A:*.ZIP /f /d     convert ZIPs on A drive with deletion of
                            each original archive upon successful
                            conversion.

    REARJ *.ARC /r          this converts all ARC files in the current
                            directory and in subdirectories of the
                            current directory to JAR files.

    REARJ SOFT.ARJ /tZIP    this converts SOFT.ARJ to SOFT.ZIP.

    REARJ *.J /u            re-archive all JAR archives.

    REARJ *.* /v /wd:\      re-archive all archives and execute
                            configured command on extracted files
                            using d:\ as the temp directory.


    EXTERNAL CONFIGURATION FILE

    REARJ comes with a configuration file, REARJ.CFG, which supports
    conversion between the ARJ, ARC, LZH, PAK, ZIP, DWC, LZS, HYP, ZOO,
    JAR formats.  The commands PKPAK and PKUNPAK are used for ARC files.
    The command LHA is used for LZH files.  You can change these defaults
    by editing the configuration file.

    The format of the configuration file is fairly simple.

    The first line can optionally specify an external command to be
    executed by REARJ when the "/v" option is selected.  This line must
    start with the word "VIRUS" minus the quotes, followed by a space,
    followed by the external command.  The external command MUST contain
    a fully specified pathname for security reasons.

    Example:  VIRUS C:\BIN\SCAN /nomem *.*

    If you do not want to configure this item, DO NOT insert a blank line.

    Each archive format requires four lines in the file.

    The first line is the format suffix.

    The second line is the archive ADD command with a %s in the place of
    the archive name.  Any other percent signs in the command must be
    preceded by "\" as in "\%".  The ADD command should support directory
    inclusion and reading of hidden and/or system files.  REARJ will parse
    this command line using the space character as the token separator.

    If your ADD command requires DOS piping as the ZOO archiver requires,
    you must precede the ADD command with the text "COMMAND /C ".

    Example:  ARJ a -a -r -jt %s
              COMMAND /C STUFF *.* | ZOO aI %s

    The third line is the archive EXTRACT command with a %s in the
    place of the archive name.  Any other percent signs in the command
    must be preceded by "\" as in "\%".  The EXTRACT command should
    support directory recreation if the archive contains directories.
    The extraction of directories must be to child directories within the
    current directory.  REARJ will parse this command line using the space
    character as the token separator.

    If your EXTRACT command requires DOS piping, you must precede the
    EXTRACT command with the text "COMMAND /C ".  Beware that command exit
    codes are not passed back to REARJ when using COMMAND /C.

    The fourth line contains the letters "A" and/or "D" or no letters.
    The "A" stands for the ability to process files with the hidden and/or
    system attribute.  The "D" stands for full support of directory trees
    within archives.  No letters (blank line) stands for no support for
    hidden or system files or for archive containing directories.

    There must be NO EXTRA blank lines or comments in the file.  You may
    use leading blanks for clarity.

    See the supplied REARJ.CFG for the current configuration.

    If you use a different archiver program, you will need to either
    rename the program to one of the supported ones or you will need to
    modify the installed REARJ.CFG file.

    If your original archive format supports extraction to absolute
    directory paths as opposed to relative directory paths and you have
    such archives containing absolute paths, you should not put directory
    extraction in the REARJ.CFG file unless you use the /w option to set
    the working directory to an empty root directory.

    You can add comment handling to the ARJ command by adding the
    "-zcomment.txt" option.  This is supported at ARJ 2.20 and above.


    LOG FILE DATA

    When logging is enabled, REARJ will log the action on each selected
    file.  For successful conversions, REARJ logs the date-time, target
    archive type, original archive size, new archive size, bytes saved,
    and original archive name.

    When selected files are skipped for any reason, REARJ will log an
    entry in the log file (when logging is enabled) which specifies the
    reason code for skipping the file.  The following are the codes:

    1  = File not found
    2  = File is not a configured archive type
    3  = Target archive already exists
    4  = Not enough disk space
    5  = User skipped or user did not select update option
    6  = UNPACK error
    7  = PACK error
    8  = Target cannot support directories
    9  = Wrong file count
    10 = Wrong total size
    11 = Internal archive REARJ error
    12 = Rename archive error
    13 = Invoked /v command error (found a virus?)
