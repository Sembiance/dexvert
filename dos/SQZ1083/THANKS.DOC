I would like to thank the following persons for their advice, both good
and bad, and their help in other ways:

    Jonny Bergdahl  for taking his time to give me a reason to implement
		    MOVE, and an error in SFX.

    Hakan Andersson for noting that the syntax used by GEcho was not the
		    same as that used by SQZ.

    Lars Ridstrom   for giving me information about things where my know-
		    ledge was, to be kind, nonexisting.
		    Pointing to the possibility of disaster if one
		    extracts to COM1/AUX and so forth.

    Rob Van.hoeven  for taking his time, pointing out some buglets and
		    supporting it in his products.

    My wife	    for not giving me up and throwing my computer though
		    the window...
		    (heard from the left :"Yet...")

    Thomas Petersson for being the one he is

    Andreas Birgersson for information on Security Envelopes.

    Patrik Sjoberg  for the report of a bugg if running in a DOS-box under
		    OS/2 and extracting to a server. Pointing out that
		    there might be more than 4096 files on a disc and that
		    sometimes it's useful to include the drive in the name.
