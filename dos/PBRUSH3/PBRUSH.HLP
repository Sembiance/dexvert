#106
Using the Keyboard
You can use the keyboard to open menus, choose commands, and select options.

Choose &Next for more information.
#107
Using the Keyboard with Tools
Press the Shift key to "constrain" some tools. Use the Esc key to stop a tool while it is in use.

If you hold down Shift while using the Paintbrush, you can draw only horizontal or vertical lines. To switch between vertical and horizontal constraint, press Spacebar.

Shift constrains the Line tool so it draws only horizontal, vertical, or 45-degree lines.

If you press Shift while using an Ellipse tool, you draw a circle; with a Box tool, you draw a square.

With the Gadget Box tool, press Shift to make the sides grow in proportion as you stretch the box. Press Shift while dragging the Gadget Box if you want to leave a single copy of the image behind. Press Ctrl while dragging the Gadget Box if you want to leave a trail of copies behind.

The Esc key will stop the Paint Roller from finishing a fill. It will stop (without drawing the figure) any tool such as Line, Box, or Ellipse while the tool is in "rubber band" mode.
#108
Using the Keyboard with Menus
To open a menu, hold down Alt and type the underlined letter in the menu title. For example, to open the File menu, press Alt+F.

To choose a command on a menu, open the menu, then press the underlined letter in the command's name. For example, to choose the Save command on the File menu, press Alt+F to open the File menu, then press S or Alt+S.
#110
Using the Keyboard with Dialog Boxes.
You can use the keyboard to move quickly in a dialog box. To move to an option or box, press the key corresponding to the underlined letter next to the field or box. For example, press F in the Save dialog box to move to the Filename box. Press Tab to move among editable fields and boxes in a dialog box.

#7
The MS Paintbrush Screen
The MS Paintbrush screen includes the menu bar, Toolbox, drawing area, pointer, scroll bars, caption bar, Color Pattern Set, and Width Box.

Choose &Next to learn more about the screen.
#19
The Menu Bar
The names at the top of the screen are the titles of the drop-down menus. Menus contain MS Paintbrush commands. You control how some commands work by selecting options in dialog boxes.

 To open the menu, click a menu title.
 To choose the command, click a command.
 To select an option, click the option in a dialog box.
#22
The Toolbox
The Toolbox contains icons representing the drawing tools. To choose a tool, point to the icon for the tool and click . To get help on using a tool, point to the tool and click .

When you choose a tool, it is highlighted in the Toolbox, and the pointer takes on the tool's shape when you point in the drawing area.

³´µ The tools that appear in the Toolbox box vary depending on the command you have chosen on the Effects or Display menus.
#42
The Color Pattern Set
The Color Pattern Set at the bottom of the screen contains the colors and patterns you draw with. The tools use the current primary, secondary, and background colors you have chosen from the Color Pattern Set.

To choose a color or pattern from the Color Pattern Set:
 Point to the color or pattern.
 Click  to choose the primary color.
 Click  to choose the secondary color.
 Hold down Shift and click  to choose the background color.

The three small boxes to the left of the Color Pattern Set show the current colors. The upper-left box shows the primary color. The lower-right box shows the secondary color. The area behind the two boxes shows the background color.

Tools normally draw with the primary color. The Box, Ellipse, and Polygon tools use the primary color to draw the borders of the shapes they create. The secondary color fills shapes created with the Filled Box, Filled Ellipse, and Filled Polygon tools. The Color Eraser, the Gradient effect, and the shadow behind text also use the secondary color. The Eraser, the New command, and the Gradient effect use the background color.

³´µ The colors and patterns in the Color Pattern Set change depending on the command you have chosen on the Effects menu. Choose Effects Standard to show the complete Color Pattern Set.
#41
The Drawing Area
You create your drawing in the drawing area. It is part of the drawing canvas--the entire area available for drawing. The size of the drawing canvas depends on how much free memory your computer has when you run MS Paintbrush.
#51
The Width Box
The Width Box, in the lower left part of the screen, shows the current line width. The Spraycan, Paintbrush, Curve, Line, Box, Ellipse, and Polygon tools draw with the current line width. You set the line width by using the Width Box or by choosing the Options Set Line Width command.

To use the Width Box:
 Point inside the Width Box.
 Click an arrow to increase or decrease the line width, or
 Drag across the line width display box, and type a new number, or
 Click the triangle and select options in the Set Line Width dialog box.
#103
Dialog Boxes
Dialog boxes can contain display boxes which show values or names of options, list boxes which show lists of filenames or options, buttons or check boxes to turn options on or off, and command buttons.

To change the value or name of an option in a display box, drag inside the display box to select the contents of the box and type the new value or name. Press Tab or point and click to move to another display box.

To select an option or filename from a list box, use the scroll bars to move through the list:
 To page through the list, click the double arrows.
 To scroll line-by-line, click the single arrows.
 To move through the list quickly, drag the small box.
 To select an option or filename, double-click its name.

To use a button or check box to turn an option on or off, click the button or check box.

To use a command button:
 Click OK to close the dialog box and use options you selected.
 Click Cancel to close the dialog box without making changes.

To use the keyboard to select an option, press Alt and the underlined letter in the option name.

³´µ You can press and drag the top bar on dialog boxes to move them around the screen.  Use this if you need to uncover important parts of your drawing.

³´µ MS Paintbrush saves many options when you save a workspace file. See Open Workspace and Save Workspace.
#17
File List Boxes
Some dialog boxes include a file list box where you can select a file to open and a filename box where you can type the name of a file to save or open. The file list box shows the subdirectories and files in the current directory. To save a file, type its name in the filename box and choose Save. To open a file, type its name in the filename box and choose Open, or double-click the filename in the file list box.

To use the mouse with file list boxes:
 Double-click "[..]" to move back one directory at a time.
 Double-click a drive letter, directory or filename to select it.
 Use the scroll bar to move through the list of files.

³´µ The filenames in a file list box depend on the type of file associated with the box. For example, if you select the PCX file format in the File Open dialog box, only files with a .PCX extension appear.
#105
Mixing RGB Colors
MS Paintbrush supports the RGB (Red Green Blue) and HLS (Hue Lightness Saturation) color systems. You can select either system to adjust the colors your computer displays.

³´µ The width value in the Width Box is always in units of pixels.
#71
Set Palette
Choose Options Set Palette to change the red, green, and blue components of a single solid color on the screen. It works like the Set Entire Palette command, but it adjusts one color at a time. Use this command if you need to change the tint of one color on the screen or if a color is not printing correctly.

Every color in the hardware palette is a solid shade. If you plan to print images, use only the hardware palette colors for best results. If you use color patterns, they may print with a checkerboard appearance.

To adjust an individual hardware palette color:
 Choose Options Set Palette.
 Choose the solid color you want to adjust by clicking either in the drawing or in the Color Pattern Set.
 Select the color model you want to use: RGB or HLS. RGB (red, green, blue) adjusts colors by changing the levels of red, green, and blue in the selected color. HLS (hue, lightness, and saturation) adjusts various values in the selected color.
