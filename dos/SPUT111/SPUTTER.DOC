  SPUTTER is a set of programs, that form a full featured sound system that
  allows you to manage and play back many different types of sound files, on
  a variety of different devices.  All conversions are handled automatically,
  regardless of the type of device used to create the sound file.

  These are some of the major features of the SPUTTER Sound System:

        * Point-and-Play shell with pull-down menus and complete file
          management capabilities to let you play digitized sound
          files, synthesized music files, and text to speech files all
          from within the same program.

        * Allows you to attach any of these types of sound files to events
          on your PC such as Program Execution, File access, Disk access,
          Alarm clock settings and replacing the original beep sound.

        * Supports many different output devices, including the PC internal
          speaker, Speech Thing, Voice Master, Sound Master, Sound Blaster,
          AdLib Music Card and any other Digital to Analog Converter.

        * Supports many different digitized sound file formats including
          Covox (Speech Thing, Voice Master, Sound Master), Creative Labs
          (Sound Blaster), Tandy, Macintosh, Amiga and IBM CVSD files.
          Also supports .ROL synthesized music files (Adlib & Sound Blaster)
          and text to speech synthesized sound.

        * Can randomly select sound files to provide variation without
          having to change batch files regularly.

        * Can resample digitized sound files, to change the playback rate
          of a file so that it can be played on slower machines.

        * Includes enhanced support for DESQview and runs as a well-behaved
          program in a DESQview window.

  *************************************************************************

  Installation of SPUTTER is very simple, just execute the following steps.

  1) Place all of the Sputter programs and required files in a directory
     that is contained in your PATH statement.  Those files are as follows:

        SPUTTER.COM             File Manager
        SPUTMON.COM             Event Monitor
        SPUT.COM                Sound & Text file player
        SPUTROL.COM             ROL file player
        SPUT.PHD                Voice file for text-to-speech
        SPUT.DIC                Sample Dictionary file for text-to-speech
        SPUTMON.DEF             Sample Event definition file
        SP-PIF.DVP              DESQview PIF for player window

  The following files are required if you will be playing ROL files, and
  are included with the Sputter Demonstration files:

        SOUND.COM               AdLib Sound driver
        STANDARD.BNK            AdLib Instrument Bank file

  The following files are also included in the distribution, but are not
  necessary for execution:

        SPUTTER.DOC             Sputter documentation file
        PHONES.TXT              List of Phonemes from the Doc file
        SAMPLES.TXT             Samples of the Phoneme-functions
        WHATS.NEW               Description of the latest changes
        FUTURE.TXT              What's planned for future releases
        USES.TXT                Some ideas for using Sputter

  2) Add a line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to define the path in which
     your sound files are stored similar to the following example:

                SET SPUTDIR=C:\SND

  3) If you are using any sound device other than the PC Internal Speaker,
     you must add a line to define the port address of your sound board:

     For VoiceMasterKey I     SET SPUTARG=/P1          (or 2,3,4)
     For VoiceMasterKey II    SET SPUTARG=/P5          (or 6,7,8)
     For SpeechThing          SET SPUTARG=/P5          (or 6,7,8)
     For SoundBlaster         SET SPUTARG=/P220-S/IR3  (or 230,240,250,260)
     For AdLib card           SET SPUTARG=/P388-A

     You may also include any permanent switches you want to define for
     the sound file player:

                SET SPUTARG=/Q2

  4) If you are using a SoundBlaster or AdLib card, add a line to define
     the path to your ROL files:

                SET SROLDIR=C:\ROL
     
     and you may optionally add a line to define any permanent switches
     you want to define for the ROL file player:

                SET SROLARG=/Q2

  *************************************************************************
                     SECTION 3.1 - SPUTTER File Manager
  *************************************************************************

  This section describes the point-and-play file manager named SPUTTER.
  From the File Manager, sound files can be played, viewed in waveform,
  viewed in ascii/hex mode, copied, renamed, moved and deleted, either
  individually or in tagged groups.

        SPUTTER [d:] [\directory] [/E] [/S] [/D] [/T] [/O]

  To start the File Manager, simply type 'SPUTTER' at the DOS prompt and
  SPUTTER presents an alphabetized listing of the current directory with
  a menu on the right.  An optional drive and directory may be specified
  as the directory to be used, instead of the current directory.

  Optionally, the /E,/S,/D,/T and /O command line switches sort the
  initial directory listing by Extension, Size, Date (/D and/T are the
  same), or Original DOS order.  Once on screen, function keys can be
  used for subsequent sorts.

  Once started, SPUTTER will initialize the display as follows:

        . The top line is the Menu line, and is activated with the F10
          function key or the slash key (/).

        . The second line shows the currently displayed drive & directory.

        . The large window on the left is the directory window and contains
          a list of files in the current directory.
          The file attributes (Archive, Hidden, Read-only and System) are
          shown by the appropriate letters to the right of the time for
          each listed file.  A period is displayed for any file attributes
          that are not set.

        . The mid-sized window on the upper right is the info window and
          contains various counters, and the state of the toggle switches.

        . The smaller window on the lower right is the preview window
          and gives a peek at the contents of the currently highlighted file.

        . The line below the windows is the message line and displays
          various prompts and messages.

        . The next line is the input line, used for entering data.

        . The last line is the function key menu.


  DOS wildcards ? and * are supported for COPY, MOVE and DELETE operations.

  Once SPUTTER has been started, the following keys have meaning:

  A-Z
        Pressing a letter, moves the highlight bar to the first (then sub-
        sequent) filename beginning with that letter.

  Up & Down
        The Up and Down arrow key moves the highlight bar up or down one
        line at a time.

  Home & End
        The Home and End keys go to either the first or last file in the
        directory.

  PgDn & PgUp
        The Page-Up and Page-Down keys allow you to scroll up and down
        through the entire directory.

  Ctrl-PgDn & Ctrl-PgUp
        The Ctrl-Page-Up and Ctrl-Page-Down move to the top and bottom of
        the current display page (21 files).

  Left-Arrow & Right-Arrow or Grey+ & Grey-
        These keys are used to mark and unmark files.  After marking or
        unmarking a file, the highlight bar is automatically moved in the
        same direction that it was moved last.
        Multiple files may be tagged for group playing, viewing, copying,
        moving or deleting.

  F1 (Help)
        This key activates the Help pull-down menu.

  F2 (Args)
        This key displays the SPUT help screen.

  F3 (Dir)
        This key will cause SPUTTER to reread the current directory.
        This is useful if files have been created or added to the
        current directory since starting SPUTTER.

  F4 (Chdir)
        This key provides a way to change the current drive and
        directory without leaving SPUTTER.

  F5 (Mark)
        This key will cause all previously unmarked files to be marked.
        Files with an asterick are considered marked.  To remark files
        with an asterick, press F6 to clear all marks, then F5 to mark
        all files.

  F6 (Clear)
        This key will unmark all files including those with astericks.

  F7 (Pause)
        This key will toggle the state of the Pause-after-output switch.

  F8 (Output)
        This key will toggle the state of the Output switch.

  F10+Sound+Play or Enter
        The Play function initiates the playback process for either
        the highlighted or marked file(s).  This option requires the
        appropriate player program to be located in a directory that is
        listed in your PATH statement.

        The player programs used are SPUT.COM for digitized sound files,
        and text to speech files and SPUTROL.COM for .ROL synthesized
        music files.

        When a marked file is successfully played, it's marker arrow is
        replaced by an asterisk.

  F10+Sound+Quick or Ctrl-Enter
        The Play with Quick-arguments function initiates playback for the
        highlighted file, after prompting for an argument string.
        The prompt will appear in the message line, and you can enter
        any valid player switch with slashes. (See the appropriate
        section of the documentation for SPUT and SPUTROL switches).

        Note that if the /W switch to SPUT is used to create an 8-bit PCM
        file, or the COPY function is used to create files in the same
        directory, those files will not appear in the directory listing
        until you press F3 to re-read the current directory.

        Initiates the copy process for the highlighted or marked file(s),
        after prompting for a destination.  Wildcards ? and * are supported
        and renaming while copying is permitted.

        When a marked file is successfully copied, it's marker arrow is
        replaced by an asterisk.  If the target disk(ette) becomes
        filled, during a copy operation, SPUTTER automatically attempts
        to find other marked files that will fit, stopping when there are
        none.  Changing the target diskette, and hitting F1 again, will
        copy the remaining marked files.

  F10+File+Move or Ctrl-M

  ***************************************************************************
                      SECTION 3.2 - SPUTMON Event Monitor
  ***************************************************************************

  This section describes the program named SPUTMON, which stands for (SPUT)ter
  Event (MON)itor.  SPUTMON is a small memory resident utility (under 5k)
  that lets you attach sound files to events that occur on your PC.
  
  Typing 'SPUTMON ?' at the DOS prompt, will display the program version and
  an abbreviated help screen.

  When using SPUTMON the Event Monitor, it is recommended that you keep a
  copy of the player utilities SPUT.COM and SPUTROL.COM on a RAM disk.
  This will reduce system overhead associated with playback at the time
  the events occur.


  ----------------------------
  SPUTMON SWITCHES & OPERATION
  ----------------------------

  ?
        Entering a question mark on the command line, will tell SPUTMON
        to display a short help screen.

  /B
        This switch toggles the state of the bells-on-error & retry option
        and defaults to enabled.

        When this feature is enabled and SPUTMON is unable to play a file
        at the time an event occurs, a high-pitched bell will sound every 30
        seconds to alert you that what you are doing is preventing playback
        to occur.

        If the retry feature has been disabled with the /R switch, SPUTMON
        will play a low pitched buzzer to indicate that playback has been
        cancelled for that event only.

        Entering a number after the /B switch, will change the frequency of
        the error/retry bells from 30 seconds to the new value.  Setting
        the value to 0, disables all bells.

  /C
        This switch toggles the state of the command-line playback feature
        and defaults to enabled.  This method of playback is only used if
        DESQview is not running, or the /W window playback feature is
        disabled.

        When at the DOS prompt, you are actually running COMMAND.COM which
        allocates all of memory to itself.  If an event is triggered, there
        is no available memory for the player program to run or load the
        sound file.  This feature causes the player program to be run from
        the DOS prompt (although you won't actually see the command).

        If you are in the middle of typing a line when an event is triggered,
        SPUTMON will not interrupt you.  The playback will just be delayed
        until you enter a carriage return.

        If you are idle at the DOS prompt, SPUTMON will print the following
        message on the screen

  <SPUTMON is ready to play, press <CTRL-SHIFT> to cancel, <CTRL-ALT> to begin>

        then SPUTMON will wait approximately 5 seconds.  If you do nothing,
        or press <CTRL-ALT>, playback will occur.  If you press <CTRL-SHIFT>
        playback for that particular event only will be cancelled.

        In both cases, a new DOS prompt will appear, and you may continue
        as usual.

  /D
        This switch will disable event monitoring, and SPUTMON will
        remain in memory.

  /E
        This switch will reenable event monitoring.

  /G
        This switch controls weather the DESQview player window will run
        in the foreground or background.  The default is background.

  /I
        This switch is used to reinitialize the event table.  All counters
        are reset to zero, and any events that were marked for playback
        are cancelled.

  /M
        This switch toggles the state of the multiple event triggering
        feature, and defaults to disabled.

        Normally, when an event occurs, SPUTMON searches the event table
        for a match.  If a match is found, the remainder of the table
        is not checked.  Enabling this feature, tells SPUTMON to check
        the entire table for additional matches.

        This switch normally will not affect type T timer events, since
        many clock interrupts will occur for each actual second of time.

        Example: If you have the following events defined in your event file

                P  DX.EXE  SHEESH.SND
                P  *       AHH.SND

        With /M disabled, running DX would only play SHEESH.SND.  With
        /M enabled, running DX would play SHEESH.SND and AHH.SND.

  /Q
        This switch toggles the quiet screen output feature, and defaults
        to enabled.

        Normally SPUTMON sends the appropriate switch to the player program
        to suppress screen output.  Disabling this feature will cause all
        screen output from the player program to be displayed.  This can
        be very useful while writing event definition files.

  /R
        This switch toggles the state of the retry playback feature and
        defaults to enabled.

        When an event occurs, and SPUTMON is unable to play the sound file,
        in the normal way, or using the /W (DV window) or /C (command line)
        methods, it looks at this switch to decide how to handle the event.

        If the retry feature is enabled, SPUTMON will remember that the
        file should be played, and will keep retrying playback until
        successful.  A short high pitched jingle will be heard every 30
        seconds to remind you that a playback is pending.

        If the retry feature is disabled, playback will be skipped for
        that particular event only, and you will hear a low pitched buzzer
        if the beep-on-error feature is enabled with /B.

  /S
        This switch prints the event table on the screen, which is a list
        of all events being monitored.

          TRIGG - is the number of times the event has triggered playback.
          ERROR - is the number of times playback has failed.
          CODE  - is the error code encountered during the last attempted
                  playback.  The first 2 digits are a number representing
                  the process that encountered the error.  A 10xx indicates
                  a player program error.  Any other number is the
                  number of the interrupt handler that encountered the error.
                  (ie: 2108 means playback was attempted by the INT21 handler
                  but failed because of insufficient memory).
          ST    - is the status of the event, with 01 meaning that the event
                  has been marked for playback.
          T     - is the type of file to be played where:
                  1 = Sound file for SPUT.COM  (blank or #S)
                  2 = ROL file for SPUTROL.COM (#R)
                  3 = Text file for SPUT.COM   (blank or #T)
                  4 = Command for COMMAND.COM  (#C)

  /U
        This switch will cause SPUTMON to remove itself from memory.
        This can only be done successfully, if no other programs have
        become memory resident since SPUTMON was loaded.

  /W
        This switch toggles the state of the DESQview player window
        feature and defaults to enabled.

        This section is only applicable when DESQview is running.

        If this feature is enabled when an event occurs, a separate
        DESQview window will be started in which to run the player program.
        This window will run in the background, and close when playback is
        finished.  It will appear as a 2x2 character box in the upper left
        hand corner of the screen.

        All of the attributes of the DV player window can be changed by
        using the DESQview "Change A Program" utility to modify the DVP
        template file SP-PIF.DVP that comes with SPUTTER.  This DVP file
        must be located somewhere in the PATH, in order for SPUTMON to find
        it when becomming memory resident.

        Disabling this feature will cause playback to occur in the same
        window in which the event occurred.

  <eventfile>
        This is the name of the event definition file.  If no filename is
        specified, the default of SPUTMON.DEF will be used.  If no directory
        is specified, the current directory is searched, and then the PATH.


  -----------------
  EVENT FILE FORMAT
  -----------------

  The event definition file is a simple ascii file, that can be modified
  with any text editor.  The maximum size of the file is limited to 64k
  bytes, including comments.

  Each line in the event file defines a single event.  The first "word" of
  each line, defines the event type and the remainder of the line describes
  the particular event to trigger on.


  -----------
  EVENT TYPES
  -----------

        B <soundfile>
                This is the BEEP event, and will trigger playback of the    
                specified soundfile in place of the normal speaker beep.

                Example: 'B CHICK.SND' plays a short clip of peeping chicks
                         instead of the normal speaker beep.

        T <sdate> <stime> <idate> <itime> <repeat> <soundfile>

                The TIMER event will trigger playback whenever the set time
                <sdate><stime> occurs.  Then the repeat <repeat> is
                decremented, and the increment <idate><itime> is added to
                the set time to create the next alarm setting.

                Alarms and repeat counts are reset automatically.

        Examples:
                T 00-00-00 12:00 00-00-00 00:00 0 YEAH.TUN
                  at noon every day
                T 06-25-90 17:00 00-00-00 00:05 5 WOW.TUN
                  from 5:00pm to 5:25 every 5 minutes on 06-25-90
                T 07-11-90 00:00 00-00-00 00:01 0 wow.tun
                  every min for 1 day
                T 07-11-90 12:00 00-01-00 00:00 2 wow.tun
                  at noon for 2 days
                T 07-00-00 12:00 00-01-00 00:00 0 wow.tun
                  at noon every day in July
                T 00-11-00 12:00 01-00-00 00:00 0 wow.tun
                  at noon on the 11th of every month
                T 07-00-90 00:00 00-00-00 01:00 0 wow.tun
                  every hour in July
                T 00-11-00 00:00 00-00-00 01:00 0 wow.tun
                  every hour on every 11th day

        P  <progname> <soundfile>
                The PROGRAM execution event will trigger playback whenever
                the specified program is run.  The program name follows the
                same rules for filenames.

                Example: 'P Q.EXE MISTAKS.V8' plays Stooge Moe saying "Now
                         don't make any more mistakes!" when Qedit is run.
                     or: 'P LIST.COM DOC.TUN' plays Bugs Bunny saying "Whats
                         up Doc?" whenever LIST is used to view a file.

        FO <filename> <soundfile>
                The FILE-OPEN event will trigger playback whenever the
                specified file is opened in read-only mode.

                Example: 'FO * CERTNLY.V8' plays Stooge Curly saying
                         "Certainly!" when any file is opened for reading.

        FC <filename> <soundfile>
                The FILE-CREATE event will trigger playback whenever the
                specified file is opened for write access.  The DOS COPY
                command will not trigger this event because of insufficient
                memory.

                Example: 'FC CONFIG.SYS HEYNOT.V8' plays Stooge Curly saying
                         "Hey not that!" when any program attemps to open
                          CONFIG.SYS for write access.

        FR <filename> <soundfile>
                The FILE-RENAME event will trigger playback whenever the
                specified file is renamed.  The DOS REName command will not
                trigger this event.

                Example: 'FR AUTOEXEC.BAT MEANING.TUN" plays Bugs Bunny
                         saying "Whats the meaning of this?" when any program
                         attempts to rename AUTOEXEC.BAT.

        FD <filename> <soundfile>
                The FILE-DELETE event will trigger playback whenever the
                specified file is deleted.  The DOS DELete command will not
                trigger this event.

                Example: 'FD * AHH.TUN' plays Yosemite Sam yelling "Ahhhhh"
                         whenever any file is deleted by any program.


        The following events are called the INT events.  They are more
        complex to setup than the above events, but are much more powerful.
        As a reference, I highly recommend "The Interrupt List" by
        Ralf Brown.  It is available on most BBS's as INTER290.ZIP.


        I  <int> <ah> <al> <soundfile>
                The vanilla INT event will trigger playback whenever the
                specified interrupt <int> occurs, with <ah> matching the AH
                register and <al> matching the AL register.

                Example:  'I 21 4C FF THATS.TUN' plays Bugs Bunny saying
                          "That's that" whenever a program terminates.

        IA <int> <ah> <al> <filename> <soundfile>
                The INT-ASCIZ event will trigger playback whenever the
                specified interrupt <int> occurs, with <ah> matching the AH
                register and <al> matching the AL register.  An additional
                check is done between <filename> and the filename pointed
                to by the DS:DX register.

                Example:  'IA 21 43 01 MYFILE CERTNLY.V8' plays Stooge Curly
                          saying "Certainly!" whenever the file attributes of
                          the file named MYFILE are set.

        IF <int> <ah> <al> <filename> <soundfile>
                The INT-FCB event will trigger playback whenever the
                specified interrupt <int> occurs, with <ah> matching the AH
                register and <al> matching the AL register.  An additional
                check is done between <filename> and the filename in the
                File-Control-Block pointed to by the DS:DX register.

                Example:  'IF 21 15 FF MYFILE HEYNOT.V8' plays Stooge Curly
                          saying "Hey, not that!" whenever a sequential
                          write is done to the file MYFILE.

        ID <int> <ah> <al> <drive> <soundfile>
                The INT-DISK event will trigger playback whenever the
                specified interrupt <int> occurs, with <ah> matching the
                AH register and <al> matching the AL register.  An additional
                check is done between <drive> and the DL register.

                Example:  'ID 13 05 ff 01 WARNING.V8' plays the Robot from Lost
                          in Space saying "Warning Warning" anytime a format
                          disk track is executed on the A drive.


  --------------------
  EVENT FILE ARGUMENTS
  --------------------

  The event type is followed by additional arguments that describe the event
  on which to trigger playback.

  Arguments may be separated by commas or any number of spaces.  They may
  appear in upper or lower case.

  The arguments used are different for each event type.  All are described
  below:

  <filename>
        A filename that may be up to 12 characters in length, and must
        include a period and extension.  It may be a single * to indicate
        a match of any filename.

  <soundfile>
        The name of the soundfile to be played at the time the event occurs.
        It may include a full path specification and any valid player
        switches.  If the sound file will be played using SPUT, you may
        also use *.* to invoke random soundfile selection.

  <int>
        This is the interrupt number in hexadecimal to monitor.      
        Only interrupts 13 and 21 are supported at this time.

  <ah>
        This is the hexadecimal contents of the AH register to be
        checked at the time of the interrupt.  Use FF to indicate
        a match on all values.

  <al>
        This is the hexadecimal contents of the AL register to be
        checked at the time of the interrupt.  Use FF to indicate
        a match on all values.

  <drive>
        This is the hexadecimal driver number, with 0 being the
        A drive, and 1 the B drive.  Use FF to indicate a match on
        any drive. 

  <sdate>
        This is the first date that the alarm should trigger in the
        format MM-DD-YY.  00 in any field, matches every value.
        06-00-90 means every day in June 1990.

  <stime>
        This is the first time that the alarm should trigger in the
        format HH:MM. 00:00 means midnight.                                   

  <idate>
        This is the increment to add to <sdate> to determine the
        next date that the alarm should trigger.  The format is
        MM-DD-YY.  01-00-00 means add 1 to the month for the next
        alarm date.  00-00-01 means add 1 to the year.

  <itime>
        This is the increment to add to <stime> to determine the
        next time that the alarm should trigger.  The format is
        HH:MM.  00:05 means 5 minutes later.  01:00 means 1 hour
        later.

  <repeat>
        This is the number of times to add the increment to the
        set time and reset the alarm.  A value of 0 means non-stop.


  -------------------------------------------------------------
  USING SPUTROL.COM FOR FM MUSIC ON SOUND BLASTER & ADLIB CARDS
  -------------------------------------------------------------

  To use SPUTROL to play a ROL file when an event occurs, just insert '#R'
  before the <soundfile> argument.
        
        Example:  'P MYPROG.EXE #R LINUS.ROL'
             or:  'T 00-00-00 12:00 00-00-00 00:00 1 #R LINUS.ROL'

        SPUTROL.COM will be used to play LINUS.ROL whenever MYPROG.EXE is
        executed, and every day at 12:00 noon.

  This does not require that the sound driver SOUND.COM already be loaded,
  SPUTROL can automatically load SOUND.COM and unload it when playback is
  completed thereby saving valuable memory.  If you plan to use this feature,
  it is recommended that you keep SOUND.COM on a RAMdisk for quicker access.

  ------------------------------------------------
  TRIGGERING OTHER PLAYERS, PROGRAMS & BATCH FILES
  ------------------------------------------------

  The Event Monitor also has the ability to start other sound file players,
  programs and batch files when an event occurs.

  To use this feature, just preceed the <soundfile> argument with '#C'.

        Example:  'FD DEMO.TMP #C TEST.BAT'
                  runs TEST.BAT when the file DEMO.TMP is deleted.


  -----------------------------------------
  USING SMOOTH TALKER SOFTWARE WITH SPUTMON
  -----------------------------------------

  To use Smooth Talker text to speech software, you must add the following
  line to your CONFIG.SYS file and reboot your system:

         'DEVICE=STDRIVER.SYS SV3 CRE TTD'

  Then load SPEECHV3 into memory.  (If using SPEECHV2, you must enter SV2
  instead of SV3 on the above line added to CONFIG.SYS).
  
  Now you can use the #C file type to convert text files to synthesized speech
  using your Smooth Talker Software.

  Example: 'FD DEMO.TMP #C COPY MESSAGE.TXT ST'
                 
           Smooth Talker will convert the text file MESSAGE.TXT to synthesized
           speech whenever the file DEMO.TMP is deleted.

  If your STDRIVER is also used by other software supporting Smooth Talker
  and gets set into a different mode so that the COPY command no longer works,
  you can use the SPUTST utility to reset it without having to reboot your
  system.  Just type the following command at the DOS prompt:

        'SPUTST SV3 CRE TTD'

  ---------------------------
  USING SPUTMON WITH DESQVIEW
  ---------------------------

  SPUTMON can be run in any DESQview window, and will only see events that
  occur in the same window.  Separate event definition files can be created
  for each application that runs in a DESQview window, or all windows can
  use the same event definition file.

  All timer events can be monitored from a single DESQview window.

  If the DESQview player window feature is enabled (/W), a separate window
  will be started in which to run the player.  This window will run in the
  background, and close when the player exits.

  If the player program runs too slowly in a background window, you can use
  /W to disable the window-player feature.  This will cause playback to occur
  in the same window that the event occured, and should then be at the correct
  playback speed.

  Currently, SPUTMON does not run properly when loaded before DESQview.

  TROUBLE SHOOTING PROBLEMS WITH EVENT TRIGGERING
  -----------------------------------------------

  ** No playback occurs at the defined event

  If playback does not occur when you expect it should, try the following
  steps to isolate the problem:

        1)  Enable the beep-on-error option with the command 'SPUTMON/B'.
            (You can check the state of the switch with SPUTMON/S)
        2)  Reinitialize the event table counters with the command 'SPUTMON/I'
        2)  Perform the same sequence of commands that should cause
            playback to occur.
        3)  Display a status with the command 'SPUTMON/S' and make a note
            of the CODE field.  This is the error code.
        4)  Continue reading to find the problem.


  ** Hear a buzzer instead of playback and Error Code = xx02

  An error code of xx02 indicates that SPUTMON could not run the player  
  utility.  When SPUTMON is initially loaded, it searches the current
  PATH found in the environment, to find all of the player utilities.
  If these files are later moved or deleted, SPUTMON will no longer be able
  to call upon them to play soundfiles.

  To resolve this problem, replace the player program that was moved
  or deleted, or unload and reload SPUTMON.

  The supported player programs are SPUT.COM, PLAYROL.EXE, TRAN.EXE and
  COMMAND.COM.


  ** Hear a buzzer instead of playback and Error Code = xx08

  An error code of xx08 indicates insufficient memory.  This means that
  the currently running program already has all of available memory
  allocated to it, and there is not enough remaining memory to run the
  player utility.

  This error will only occur if you have disabled the DESQview-player-
  window feature (/W) and the command-line-playback feature (/C) and
  the retry feature (/R).  Reenabling any of these features will solve
  this problem.

  If you choose not to enable these features, an alternative solution 
  is to use the PROGRAM execution event to trigger playback when the
  offending program is run, instead of triggering on what the program
  is doing.  Other than this, nothing else can be done to solve this
  problem, unless you have access to the source code of the offending
  program.


  ** Buzzer instead of playback and Error Code = 10xx

  An error code of 10xx indicates that SPUTMON ran the player utility, but
  the player encountered an error.  Refer to the section on the SPUT utility
  for a list of SPUT error numbers and messages.

  Normally, SPUTMON runs the player utility with the proper switches so
  there will be no screen output while other programs are running.
  Disabling this feature with the /Q switch, will allow the player to
  display all it's normal screen output, including error messages.


  ** No playback when event is caused by any of the SPUTTER utilities

  This has been done intentionally, otherwise invoking any of the SPUTTER
  utilities causes multiple soundfiles to be played.  Enough is enough I say.
  All SPUTTER utilities issue a special command to SPUTMON to temporarily
  disable triggering of events caused by the SPUTTER utilities.
  Triggering and playback of type T timer events will continue uninterrupted.

        Rate:152  Over:1  Freq:11363hz  Time:0.2s
        Samples Output:12675  Silence groups:10  Timer Adjust:20


  File:
        This is the name of the file entered on the command line to SPUT.

  Size:
        The first number is the size of the file in bytes, the second
        is the actual byte size of the data to be played.

  Form:
        The first number is the file format (see /F for definitions)
        The second number indicates Macintosh file compression:

                0 - non-compression
                1 - run length encoding (RLE)
                2 - Dynamic Lempel-Ziv,Weiss compression
                3 - Huffman compression

  Port:
        This is the hex address of the port being used for output.

  Driv:
        This is the driver number used to drive the output device.

  Rate:
        This is the playback rate, specified on the command line, or taken
        from the header record, or recalculated for oversampling.

  Over:
        This is the oversampling factor currently being used.

  Freq:
        This is the frequency (samples per second) that the file is being
        played at.

  Time:        
        This is the approximate time it will take to playback the file
        at the current settings.

  Title:
        This only appears when playing Macintosh sound files and comes
        from the internal header record of the sound file.

  Samples Output:
        This is a count of the bytes actually sent to the output device and
        includes all bytes reconstructed as a result of silence encoding,
        and compression.  In third example above, the file uses only 6508
        bytes of disk space to store a file that originally contained
        12126 bytes of sound.

  Silence groups:
        This is how many periods of silence were found in the file, and
        expanded back to their original length.


  --------------------------
  SPUT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
  --------------------------

  SPUTARG
        This allows you to setup any permanent switches that you would
        like SPUT to use every time it's run, without having to enter
        them on the command line.  Any switches specified on the command
        line, will override the switches in the SPUTARG variable.

        You can set this value at the DOS prompt, or by including a line
        in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file with the following command:

                set sputarg=/p220s/ir7

        This tells SPUT to send all output to a Sound Blaster card
        at port 220 (hex), using interrupt number 7.


  SPUTDIR
        This defines the default directory to find sound files.  If a
        filename is given on the command line with no drive or directory,
        SPUT will look for the file in the directory defined by the
        SPUTDIR variable.

        You can set this value at the DOS prompt, or from your AUTOEXEC.BAT
        file with the following command:

                set sputdir=c:\sound

        This would tell SPUT to look in the SOUND directory on the
        C: drive for all sound files.

        To force SPUT to play a file in the current directory without
        having to enter the complete path, use the following command:

                sput .\filename


  ------------------------
  SPUT SYNTAX AND SWITCHES
  ------------------------

  Syntax:  SPUT <soundfile> [/switches]

  ESCAPE key
        Pressing the ESCAPE key during file playback, will cause SPUT to
        immediately stop playback and exit.  This will not disturb any
        type ahead already in the keyboard buffer.

  ?
        Entering a question mark on the command line, will tell SPUT to
        display a short help screen.

  <soundfile>
        This is the name of the sound file to be played.  If no directory
        is specified, the directory specified by the environment variable
        SPUTDIR will be used.  If the SPUTDIR variable does not exist, the
        current directory is assumed.

        Specifying a directory as part of the filename, will override
        any directory specified by the SPUTDIR environment variable.  Use
        ".\filename" to indicate the current directory and ignore the
        SPUTDIR environment variable.

        Wildcards within the filename, tell SPUT to randomly select and
        play a file that matches the wildcard mask.  This provides a
        way to have SPUT vary the sound files that are played without
        always having to change your batch files.

        Sound files can be categorized in two different ways, the first
        is by directory, where sound files are categorized and stored in
        separate directories, with a different directory for each category.
        To randomly play any file of a particularily category, just specify
        the directory.  The command "SPUT \SND\CARTOONS\*.*" would randomly
        select and play a file from the CARTOONS sub-directory and the
        command "SPUT \SND\ERRORS\*.*" would randomly select and play a
        file from the ERRORS sub-directory.

        The other method of categorization is by file extension.  This
        method keeps all sound files in the same directory, with files of
        the same category having the same file extension.  Then the command
        "SPUT \SND\*.MUS" would randomly select one of the files with the
        .MUS extension from the SND directory.  The command "SPUT *.*"
        would then select and play a file from any category.

        Note that the filename and extension hold no special meaning
        for SPUT.  Any information needed for playback is retrieved
        from within the file.  Any reference to extensions within the
        SPUTTER documentation, is simply to aid you in determining the
        file format.  SPUT can always determine the file format from
        the contents of the file regardless of the filename & extension.

  /An
        This switch will enhance the amplitude, or volume, of a soundfile.
        Using this switch, causes more processing to be performed on each
        sample of the soundfile, and may actually slow down the playback
        speed on slower processors.  The higher the N value, the more
        processing being done on each sample.

        If using this switch, slows the playback speed on your system, 
        you can use the /A switch in conjunction with the /W switch to
        write the file to disk.  The new file will play properly with
        no switches, and the amplitude will be elevated.

        Another alternative is to resample the file to a lower playback
        rate using the /U and /W switches.  Then you can replay the new
        file using the /A switch without bogging down your system.

  /Cn
        This will cause the selected file to be played N times, in a
        continous loop.  A value of 0 will play indefinetly, until a
        key is struck.  This is most useful for listening to the quality
        of a very short sound clip, or can be used as an alarm
        triggered SPUTMON the Event Monitor.

  /Dn
        This switch is used to select the method of output to be used
        on the currently selected output device.

        The Internal Speaker has 4 drivers, the default is #1.

          1 - This method uses a software timing loop to drive the
              8253 Programmable Interval Timer chip.  The routine
              calibrates itself by polling the Timer chip while
              outputting the first 64 bytes of the file.
              This driver gives the best results, since no additional
              background noise is caused by interrupts or sampling.
              It will not cause crashes on slower systems, but it's
              speed is slightly less accurate than the other methods.

          2 - This method polls the Timer chip while outputting the
              sound file.  It's speed is accurate, and like method 1
              will not cause crashes on slower systems, but it generates
              slightly more noise than method 3 (interrupts).

          3 - This method uses Timer interrupts to output the sound file.
              It's speed is accurate, it generates slightly more noise
              than method 1 (software timing), but it may crash slower
              systems when using too fast a speed or oversampling factor.
              When this method is used in DESQview, the keyboard is
              automatically disabled to prevent crashing the system.

          4 - This method uses the 8255 Peripheral Interface Controller
              to generate sound.  It's speed is accurate, but the sound
              quality is appreciably lower than the other methods, since
              only a single bit of each 8-bit sample is actually output.

        The Sound Blaster has 2 drivers, the default is #1.

              SPUT will automatically select the correct Sound Blaster
              driver depending on the environment it is running in, and
              the file format that is being played.

          1 - This driver uses the direct mode of output to the Sound
              Blaster DAC port.  This is completely CPU driven and can
              be interrupted by background processing in a multitasking
              environment.

              This driver has the capability of sending ANY file format
              from any other source to the Sound Blaster card, but does
              NOT support formats 42,44,45.

          2 - This driver uses the DMA mode of the Sound Blaster DAC port.
              It cannot be used in a multitasking environment, since there
              would be a conflict between the DMA and memory paging.
              This is also true of the VOUT.EXE utility that comes with the
              Sound Blaster card.  (This will be resolved in a future
              release of SPUT.)

              This driver can handle formats 42,44,45,48 and any other 8-bit
              file format (08,28,38), and provides the /SHELL function,
              but does NOT support any of the other compressed file formats
              (01-04,11,21,31,81-84).

  /DE
        Normally SPUT assumes that other processes already running, are
        more important than sound playback, so if other tasks are running
        when SPUT attempts to play a file, playback may be slightly slower
        than expected.  This is done mainly to not disrupt any communications
        tasks that might be running when SPUT is started.

        You may use /DE to force SPUT to run in dedicated mode and pause all
        other tasks in order to play the soundfile correctly.

  /DI
        This switch is used to specify an alternate dictionary file.  The
        default dictionary filename is SPUT.DIC.  The file is assumed to be
        located in the current directory or in the PATH.
        This file is used during text-to-speech translation and contains
        any pronounciation corrections or user definitions.
        See the next section for a description of this file.

  /Fnn
        The /F switch is used to force SPUT to use a specific file
        format.  This may be necessary when the file is missing a
        proper header record, which SPUT needs to determine the
        file format automatically.

        If you play a file with no switches, and it does not playback
        correctly, try using all possible /F switches until the file
        plays correctly.  If SPUT still fails to playback the file
        with any of the /F switches, you may have a file format that
        SPUT doesn't know about.

        SPUT has the capability of playing ANY file format on ANY device
        that it supports, not just the device that the file format may
        have been created on.  The only exception to this are formats
        42,44,45 which can only be played on a Sound Blaster card.

        If you find a file format that SPUT doesn't understand, please
        send me a copy of the file and any others similar to it, so that
        I can try to decipher the format and add it to a future release
        of SPUTTER.

        File formats:
 
        01 - Covox 1-bit ADPCM with 16-byte header (.V1)

             Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation is a technique
             of encoding the original waveform into a smaller file.
             This format uses a series of 16 byte groups with the first
             byte being an amplitude byte and the remaining 15 bytes
             are data.  Each data byte contains 8 1-bit samples.  Each
             of these 16-byte groups decodes into 120 8-bit samples.
             This format yields a 1:8 or 1/8 compression ratio.

        02 - Covox 2-bit ADPCM with 16-byte header (.V2)

             This format uses a series of 2 byte groups where 1 bit of
             each of the two bytes is combined to form a 2-bit sample.
             Each two byte group contains 8 of these 2-bit samples.
             The 2-bit samples are then decoded into 8-bit samples before
             playback.  This format yields a 2:8 or 1/4 compression ratio.

        03 - Covox 3-bit ADPCM with 16-byte header (.V3)

             This format uses a series of 3 byte groups where 1 bit of
             each of the three bytes is combined to form a 3-bit sample.
             Each three byte group contains 8 of these 3-bit samples.
             The 3-bit samples are then decoded into 8-bit samples before
             playback.  This format yields a 3:8 or 3/8 compression ratio.

        04 - Covox 4-bit ADPCM with 16-byte header (.V4)

             This format uses a series of 4 byte groups where 1 bit of
             each of the four bytes is combined to form a 4-bit sample.
             Each four byte group contains 8 of these 4-bit samples.
             The 4-bit samples are then decoded into 8-bit samples before
             playback.  This format yields a 4:8 or 1/2 compression ratio.

        08 - Covox 8-bit PCM with 16-byte header (.V8)
             or Covox 8-bit PCM with 128-byte header (.VMF)
             or Covox 8-bit PCM with no header (.VMD)
             or any other 8-bit PCM file

             Uniform Pulse Code Modulation stores a waveform as a
             sequence of 8-bit numbers representing different amplitudes.
             Amplitude levels -128 to -1 are represented by the numbers
             0  to 127, level 0 is represented by 128 and levels 1 to 128
             are represented by the numbers 129 to 255.

             .  Deskmate Software by Tandy for 1000SL/TL/2s computers.
             .  Tandy Sound Digitizer by KSH Software.

        10 - Text files

             Any text file to be translated into speech.

        11 - IBM 1-bit CVSD format files

             Continously Variable Slope Delta Modulation records the
             direction of the waveform bit by bit.  If the wave goes up
             from the previous sample, a "1" bit is recorded otherwise
             a "0" bit is recorded.  Absolute silence is recorded as
             "01010101...".  The bit stream is stored from right to
             left in each data byte.
             This format yields a 1:8 or 1/8 compression ratio.

             Programs that use this format:
             .  IBM's education software such as "Writing to Read"
                with a 128-byte header.
             .  Compton's Multimedia Encyclopedia program on CD ROM.

        21 - Digicorder 1-bit CVSD format files

             This format is similar to format 11, except that the bit
             stream is stored from left to right within each data byte.
             This format yields a 1:8 or 1/8 compression ratio.

             Programs that use this format:
             .  Digicorder & Mimic by Eletech Electronics with a numeric
                extension indicating the recording rate in bits-per-second,
                and no header record.

        28 - Amiga 8-bit PCM with 8SVX variable length header (.SND)
             or Amiga 8-bit PCM with Sonix 64-byte header (.SND)
             or Atari 8-bit PCM files (.SND)

             This format is similar to 8-bit PCM, but stores the actual
             amplitude level with polarity intact.  Negative amplitudes
             are represented by -128 to -1, level 0 is represented by 0
             and positive amplitudes are represented by +1 to +128.

             Programs that use this format:
             .  Perfect Sound by Sunrize Industries for the Amiga
                with a 128-byte 8SVX style header record.
             .  Audio Master for the Amiga, with a 128-byte 8SVX header.
             .  Sonix for the Amiga, with a 64-byte header record.

        31 - Voice Toolkit 1-bit format files

             This format simply takes bit-4 of each original 8-bit sample
             and stores the bit stream from left to right within each
             data byte.
             This format yields a 1:8 or 1/8 compression ratio.

             Programs that use this format:
             .  Digitized Voice Toolkit for the PC, by Farpoint
                Software; Alan D. Jones, with a .VOI extension.
                NOTE: This shareware package includes the schematics
                for a build-it-yourself digitizer that is attached to
                any COM port for recording.

        38 - Macintosh 8-bit PCM with MacBinary FSSD 128-byte header (.SND)

             This file format is the same as format 08, with a different
             type of header record.  No compression is currently supported.

        42 - Creative Labs 2-bit ADPCM with 16-byte header (.VOC)

             This is a compressed file format, that is automatically
             decompressed by the hardware, and can only be played
             on a Sound Blaster card.

        44 - Creative Labs 4-bit ADPCM with 16-byte header (.VOC)

             This is a compressed file format, that is automatically
             decompressed by the hardware, and can only be played
             on a Sound Blaster card.

        45 - Creative Labs 2.5-bit ADPCM with 16-byte header (.VOC)

             This is a compressed file format, that is automatically
             decompressed by the hardware, and can only be played
             on a Sound Blaster card.

        48 - Creative Labs 8-bit PCM with 16-byte header (.VOC)

             This format is the same as format 08, with a different type
             of header record, and can be played on any device.

             This format is used by the Sound Blaster and Game Blaster
             cards from Creative Labs.

        81 - Covox 1-bit ADPCM with silence encoding (.V1S)

             This format is the same as format 01, but includes the use
             of silence encoding.

             Silence encoding is a form of compression that uses 3 bytes
             to represent up to 32640 multiple continous bytes of silence.
             This technique can save a considerable amount of disk space
             without affecting the sound quality.  Many periods of silence
             occur between words and syllables and at the beginning and end
             of sound files.
        
             DEMO123.V8S is an example of a silence encoded file.  You can
             play it back with no switches for normal playback, or you can
             use the /F8 switch to hear just the non-silent passages.  The
             little cracks you'll hear with the /F8 switch are the places
             where silence has been encoded into just a few bytes.         

             Currently, only sound files created by Covox programs have
             silence encoding, but a future release of SPUTTER, will include
             a utility to rewrite any sound files using silence encoding.

        82 - Covox 2-bit ADPCM with silence encoding (.V2S)

             This format is the same as format 02, but includes the use
             of silence encoding.

        83 - Covox 3-bit ADPCM with silence encoding (.V3S)

             This format is the same as format 03, but includes the use
             of silence encoding.

        84 - Covox 4-bit ADPCM with silence encoding (.V4S)

             This format is the same as format 04, but includes the use
             of silence encoding.

        88 - Covox 8-bit PCM with silence encoding (.V8S)

             This format is the same as format 08, but includes the use
             of silence encoding.

  /Hi,r
        This switch will cause high-pass filtering to be applied to the
        data before being played.  This technique is known as Differential
        Quantization & is based on the fact that there is considerable
        correlation between adjacent speech samples.  The interval <i>,
        determines the distance between samples to be differentiated.
        Using a repeat value <r> greater than 1 will heighten the effect.

        This switch can only be used on 8-bit PCM data with no compression
        or silence encoding.  Using the switch with any other file format
        will produce an error message.  To apply high-pass filtering to
        any other file format, you must first use the /W switch to write
        the desired file out into 8-bit PCM format, and then use the /H
        switch on the new file.

  /I
        This switch will display on screen, all the file information that
        is normally displayed when the file is played, but without any
        playback occurring.

  /IRn
        This switch allows you to specify the Interrupt Request line that
        your Sound Blaster card is set for.  The default is 3, with valid
        values being 2,3,5,7.

  /K
        This switch will cause SPUT to ignore all keyboard input while
        playing a soundfile.

  /Li,r
        This switch will cause low-pass filtering to be applied to the
        data before being played.  This technique is known as Integration.
        The interval <i> determines the distance between samples to be
        integrated.  Using a repeat value <r> greater than 1 will heighten
        the effect.

        This switch can only be used on 8-bit PCM data with no compression
        or silence encoding.  See /H for directions on applying low-pass
        filtering to other file formats.

  /N
        This switch will generate very low-level noise in place of dead
        silence, when playing back files with silence encoding.
        Sometimes, when periods of silence are obvious, this can help
        make it more natural sounding.

  /On
        The /O switch is used to invoke the oversampling option for the
        internal speaker only.  This can be used to help eliminate
        sampling whine in files that were recorded at a sampling rate
        below 12000 samples-per-second.
  
        When the /O switch is used alone, or before the /R switch on
        the command line, SPUT will use the specified playback rate to
        calculate a new playback rate to be used while oversampling.

        For example, if a file plays correctly at a rate of 132 (9622hz)
        but yields high sampling whine, using the /O2/R132 switches will
        cause SPUT to double the playback rate from 9622hz to 19244hz
        and oversample by a factor of 2.  This causes the file to be played
        back twice as fast, but each byte is being played twice now, so
        it sounds the same with the sampling whine removed.

        The switch is ignored, when sending output to any port other
        than the internal speaker.

  /Pnnn
        This switch allows selection of the desired output port.

        Port Values:

            0     - Internal speaker (default)
            1-4   - Voice Master (VM0-3)
            5-8   - Speech Thing (LPT1-4)
            9     - Sound Master (SM)
            nnn   - hex port address of any other Digital to Analog Converter
            nnn-A - hex port address of an AdLib music card
            nnn-S - hex port address of a Sound Blaster card

  /PH
        This switch will cause SPUT to display the phonemes used to
        form words during text-to-speech translation.

  /Qn
        This switch is used to set the desired level of screen output.
                /Q0     display all output
                /Q1     display none
                /Q2     display errors only

  /Rnnn
        The /R switch is used to force SPUT to use a specific playback
        rate.  This may be necessary when the file is missing a proper
        header record, or the playback or record rate is not available.

        When the playback rate is not available, it will default to
        152 for Macintosh files and 182 for all other files.

        When the /R switch appears before the /O switch on the command
        line, SPUT will use the specified playback rate for oversampling
        and not perform any other calculation.
            
        When the /O switch appears before the /R switch on the command
        line, SPUT will use the specified playback rate to calculate
        a new playback rate to be used while oversampling.  See the /O
        switch for details.

        Rate Frequency Approximations:

               1  4679hz   152 11473hz   202 22096hz  
              66  6279hz   161 12559hz   212 27118hz
             110  8172hz   171 14037hz   222 35094hz
             132  9622hz   182 16124hz   232 49716hz
             140 10286hz   192 18643hz   242 85227hz

  /RSnnn
        This switch tells SPUT to resample the selected sound file
        while writing it to disk.  It is only applicable when used in
        conjunction with the /W switch.

        Resampling is a process where the playback rate of the specified
        soundfile is changed to the rate you specify with the /RS switch.

        Now virtually any sound file can be played on virtually any
        machine, no matter what the speed of the machine.  If a file
        will not play properly on a slower machine, just resample it
        down to a rate that runs properly on that machine.

        Resampling also has the pleasant side effect of reducing the
        size of the sound file.  The greater the reduction in playback
        rate, the greater the reduction in file size.

  /RU
        This switch will cause SPUT to display the rule numbers used
        when forming words during text-to-speech translation.

  /SH
        You lucky Sound Blaster owners can use this switch to shell to
        the DOS prompt while SPUT is playing your sound file in the
        background.

        As soon as playback is started, SPUT will start a DOS shell and
        print the following message:

                ** Type EXIT anytime to return to SPUT **

        You will then see the familiar DOS prompt where you can run any
        program, to do whatever you like (including running SPUT as long
        as you access a different sound port).
        Whenever you decide to quit the shell, just type 'EXIT' at the DOS
        prompt and you will return to SPUT.

        If playback is finished, SPUT will end and return to whatever
        task it was called by, otherwise SPUT will display the following
        message and wait for playback to complete before exiting:

        ** Waiting for playback to finish (press ESCAPE to abort) **

  /T
        Use this switch to enhance treble output of a sound file.

        This uses 3 level non-uniform quantization, which divides the
        entire amplitude range into 3 ranges and assigns the same amplitude
        value to all samples falling in the upper and lower ranges.
        All samples in the low range are set to 0, all samples in the
        high range are set to 255 and all samples falling in the middle
        range are doubled up to 127.  Samples in the middle range above
        127 are clipped.

  /TI
        This switch will cause SPUT to digitize the current time.

  /TX
        This will cause SPUT to enter interactive text mode and display
        a prompt (>).  Any words typed will be digitized when the
        ENTER key is pressed.  Press CTRL-C to exit interactive text
        mode and return to the DOS prompt.

        During interactive text mode, phonemes and phoneme-functions may
        be entered along with regular text to be digitized.  

  /V<f>
        This switch is used to specify an alternate voice file.  The
        default voice filename is SPUT.PHD.  The file is assumed to be
        located in the current directory or in the PATH.

  /W<f> 
        This switch will cause all output to be redirected to a disk file
        instead of being played.  The format of the output file is
        always 8-bit PCM with a 16-byte Covox style header record.

        All file formats are converted to 8-bit PCM just before being
        output to the selected device.  This switch causes that 8-bit
        PCM data to be captured to a disk file, which can then be
        manipulated much more easily than the other file formats.

        The captured file can be replayed with SPUT using the /H and
        /L switches for high/low-pass filtering, or the waveform of the
        file can be viewed with SPUTWAVE, or the file can be edited
        with a sound file editor.

        Keep in mind that the samples in the output file will reflect
        all switches that were active at the time the file was created.
        If /T is used for treble enhancement, then playing the new file
        with no switch will sound the same as playing the original with
        the /T switch.


  ---------------------------
  SPUT DICTIONARY FILE FORMAT
  ---------------------------

        The dictionary file is used to correct SPUT's pronounciation
        errors or change any other attributes of a word like volume or
        speed.  You can also use the dictionary to translate words and
        abbreviations into complete words and phrases. 

        The format of the file is straight ascii created with any text
        editor program.  Each entry is 2 lines.

        The first line is the english word and may be in any case.
        The second line is the correct phoneme string to be used to
        pronounce the word, and may also contain simple text, Smooth
        Talker style phonemes and any special phoneme functions that
        are described in the following section.

        The following is an example of a simple phoneme definition to
        correct a mis-pronounciation:

                COW
                ~k-ow

        The following example uses SmoothTalker style phonemes:

                diaper
                <<~dAY4EYp3ER>>

        The following example uses phoneme-functions to make the second
        syllable louder:

                FANTASTIC
                ~f-ae-n-a3+-t-ae-s-a0-t-ih-k

        The following example uses phoneme-functions to make the entire
        word softer:

                WHISPER
                ~a4--wh-ih-s-p-er-a0

        The following example uses simple text to define an abbreviation
        expansion:

                DAC
                digital to analog converter


  ------------------------
  SPUT PHONEME DEFINITIONS
  ------------------------

  Phoneme strings always start with the tilde character (~) followed by each
  of the phonemes separated by dashes.  A space or any control character
  ends the word.  (eg.  ~v-ey-p-er is the word VAPOR)
  SPUT phonemes are not case sensitive, and are compatible with TRAN phonemes.

  SmoothTalker phonemes are supported so that any files that already contain
  SmoothTalker phonemes will be interpreted correctly by SPUT.
  
  Many of the SmoothTalker phonemes have the same name as the SPUT
  phonemes, but those marked with an asterisk (*) are differrent.
  To create a SmoothTalker phoneme string, start the word with 2 less than
  signs, followed by the tilde character, then the string of phonemes,
  followed by 2 greater than signs to end the word. (eg. <<~vEYpER>> )
  SmoothTalker phonemes are case sensitive.

   ----------------------
   SPUT PHONEME FUNCTIONS
   ----------------------

   The special phoneme-functions may be used at the > prompt, in a text file
   or in the exception dictionary.  The changes caused by a phoneme-function
   remain in effect until another matching phoneme-function is processed.

   They may appear alone as in the following example:
        ~A2 loud ~A3 louder ~A3 even louder ~A0 back to normal
   or as part of a phoneme string as in this example:
        ~F-AE-N-A3+-T-AE-S-A0-T-IH-K.


   An   The amplitude function is used to vary the amplitude or volume
        of the created speech.

        Use n or n+ to increase the amplitude
            n- to decrease the amplitude
            0 to return to normal amplitude

        ~A1+ or ~A1 increases the volume 1 step.
        ~A1- decreases the volume 1 step.
        ~A0 sets the volume back to normal.

        Example:  At the > prompt type "this is ~a3 louder"
                  or "this is ~a3- softer"
                  or "this is loudly"  (LOUDLY is in the dictionary file)
                  or type "SPUT .\SAMPLES.TXT" to hear more examples.

   Rn   The rate function is used to vary the rate of the speech.

        Use n to set a new rate
            n+ to increase the current rate
            n- to decrease the current rate
            0 to return to the normal rate

        ~R10+ increases the rate by 10 (relative to current rate)
        ~R10- decreases the rate by 10 (relative to current rate)
        ~R202 sets the rate to 202 (absolute setting)
        ~R0 set the rate back to normal.

        Example:  At the > prompt type "this is ~r10+ faster"
                  or "this is ~r10- slower"
                  or type "SPUT .\SAMPLES.TXT" for more examples.

   Mn   The mode function is used to change between word and letter modes.

        Use 1 to switch to letter mode
            0 to switch to word mode (default)        

        Example:  At the > prompt type "this is ~M1 letter mode"
                  or "~M0 this is word mode again"
                  or type "SPUT .\SAMPLES.TXT" for more examples.

   Pn   The punctuation function is used to change the amount of punctuation
        that will be pronounced.

        Use 0 to pronounce no punctuation (none)

            1 to pronounce some punctuation (default)
                 # $ % & = @ + < > ! /
                 and . (point) if followed by a character

            2 to pronounce most punctuation
                 all level 1 punctuation and
                 " ' ( ) * , - : ; ? [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~
                 and . (period)                   

            3 to pronounce all punctuation
                 all level 1+2 punctuation
                 and all control characters (not yet implemented)

  TROUBLE SHOOTING PROBLEMS WITH PLAYBACK
  ---------------------------------------

  ** File plays too slowly (with or without any optional switches)

  This is simply the result of trying to play a file with too high a
  playback rate on too slow of a machine.  A RATE of 180 seems to be
  the fastest rate that an 8mhz AT machine can play, with no SPUT switches.
  Adding switches causes more processing to be done, and will slowdown
  playback even further.

  The solution is to run the file through SPUT with the /RS and /W switches
  to resample the file down to a lower playback rate that the machine
  can handle (ie: SPUT file/RS100/Wfile2).  If the new file still plays
  too slowly, then try the process again using a lower playback rate.


  ****************************************************************************
                 SECTION 3.4 - SPUTROL ROL File Player Utility
  ****************************************************************************

  This section describes the ROL file player program named SPUTROL.

  Very little memory is required to run SPUTROL, only 12k for the program,
  and enough additional memory to read the BANK file and the ROL file.
  That's it!  To play a 5k ROL file with a 10k BANK file requires only 27k
  of memory.  If you plan on letting SPUTROL load the AdLib sound driver
  SOUND.COM, then an additional 18k of memory will be required, but only
  for the duration of the song playing.  All memory is released when the
  song is finished.

  Another feature of SPUTROL is intelligent instrument substitution.  When
  an instrument is not found in the Bank file, SPUTROL will attempt to find
  a close match instead of defaulting to PIANO1.  You can also specify
  your own instrument substitutions if you prefer.

  Typing 'SPUTROL' with no arguments at the DOS prompt, will print the
  version number and a short help screen.

  If you are an unregistered user, you will also see the following message
  whenever playback is completed.

  1st line:
        This is the program title, version and copyright statement.

  2nd and 3rd lines:
        These lines will only be displayed when the AdLib sound driver
        SOUND.COM has not been loaded prior to running SPUTROL.  In this
        case, SPUTROL will automatically find and load SOUND.COM and then
        remove it from memory when playback is completed.  When using this
        feature, it is recommended that you keep a copy of SOUND.COM on a
        RAMdisk if available.  The sound driver should also be in a
        directory that is in the current path statement.
        
  BNK File:
        This is the name of the bank file that is being used for playback.
        Also displayed is the version number of the bank file format, and
        the number of used/total entries in the bank file.  The PATH is
        automatically searched to find STANDARD.BNK if a bank file is not
        specified on the command line.

  ROL File:
        This is the name of the ROL file that is being played.
        The extension is not required when specifying a file to be played,
        and files may be renamed using any convenient extension.

  Mode:
        This is the mode of the file being played.  Zero is melodic mode
        which uses voices 1-8 and one is percussive mode, which uses voices
        1-6 in melodic mode and voices 7-11 in percussive mode.

  TPB:
        This is the number of ticks-per-beat defined for this song.

  BPM:
        This is the number of beats-per-measure defined for this song.

  Tempo:
        This is the tempo that the song is being played at, and may be
        changed with the /T switch.

  TemEvents:
        This is the total number of tempo changes that occur in the song.

  Voice Length Inst Instrument Names (VolumeChanges/PitchChanges)
        One line of information is printed for each of the 11 voices and
        contains the following information:
        Voice - the voice number.
        Length - the length of the voice in ticks.
        Inst - the number of instrument changes for this voice.
        Instrument Names - The names of the instruments for this voice.
                An instrument name followed by a slash and another instrument
                names indicates that a substitution has been made.
        (VolChanges/PitChanges) - The number of volume and pitch changes.

  Time to play:
        This is the estimated time that the song will take to play.

  Loading song into driver:
        This indicates that SPUTROL is in the process of loading the song
        into the AdLib sound driver.

  Playback has started: 
        This indicates that SPUTROL has filled the AdLib sound driver
        buffer and the driver has started to play the song.

        like SPUTROL to use every time it's run, without having to enter
        them on the command line.  Any switches specified on the command
        line, will override the switches in the SROLARG variable.

        You can set this value at the DOS prompt, or by including a line
        in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file with the following command:

                set srolarg=/q2


  SROLDIR
        This defines the default directory to find ROL files.  If a
        filename is given on the command line with no drive or directory,
        SPUTROL will look for the file in the directory defined by the
        SROLDIR variable.

        You can set this value at the DOS prompt, or from your AUTOEXEC.BAT
        file with the following command:

                set sroldir=c:\rol

        This tells SPUTROL to look in the ROL directory on the
        C: drive for all ROL files.

        To force SPUTROL to play a file in the current directory without
        having to enter the complete path, use the following command:

                sputrol .\filename


  -------------------------
  SPUTROL SYNTAX & SWITCHES
  -------------------------

  Syntax:  SPUTROL <rolfile> [<bankfile>] [/switches]

  <rolfile>
        This is the name of the ROL file to be played.  Any valid DOS
        wildcards may be used to have SPUTROL randomly select a ROL file.
        The extension is not required, and ROL files may be renamed using
        any convenient extension.

        If no path is specified, the drive:directory specified by the
        SROLDIR environment variable will be searched, otherwise the
        current directory is assumed.

        Specifying a directory as part of the filename, will override
        any directory specified by the SROLDIR environment variable.  Use
        ".\filename" to indicate the current directory and ignore the
        SROLDIR environment variable.

  [<bankfile>]
        This argument is optional, and if used is the name of the bank file
        to be used.  The default name is STANDARD.BNK in the current
        directory, or any directory in the PATH statement.

  [/switches]
        All switches are optional.  The SROLARG environment variable is
        checked first for any permanent switches.  Any switches given on
        the command line will then override the SROLARG switches.
        The valid switches are listed below.

  ESCAPE key
        Pressing the ESCAPE key during file playback, will cause SPUTROL to
        immediately stop playback and exit.  This will not disturb any
        type ahead already in the keyboard buffer.

  ?
        Entering a question mark on the command line, will tell SPUTROL to
        display a short help screen.

  /An
        This switch can be used to modify the amplitude or volume of
        a song.  Using a positive number (/An or /An+) will increase the
        volume, and a negative number (/An- ) will decrease the volume.

  /Cn
        This will cause the song file to be played N times, in a
        continous loop.  A value of 0 will play indefinetly, until the
        ESCAPE key is struck.

  /I
        This switch will display on screen, all the file information that
        is normally displayed when the file is played, but without any
        playback occurring.

  /IF
        Normally when SPUTROL detects an invalid ROL file, an error message
        is displayed and the song is not played.  This switch can be used
        to force SPUTROL to play an invalid ROL file format.

  /ISold1=new1,old2=new2
        This switch is used to specify instrument substitutions, where
        OLD1 is the name of the original instrument and NEW1 is the name
        of the instrument to be used in its place.  Up to 5 substitutions
        may be specified, separated by commas.

  /IN
        Normally, only the first 6 instruments are displayed for each voice
        so that the file information will all fit on a single screen.
        Use this switch to force SPUTROL to display all instruments used
        for each of the voices.

  /K
        This switch causes SPUTROL to kill the song that was left playing
        in the background.

  /Mn
        This switch can be used to change the mode of the song.  Zero is
        melodic and uses voices 1-8, and one is percussive and uses voices
        1-6 in melodic mode and voices 7-11 in percussive mode.

  /NW
        This is the NOWAIT switch tells SPUTROL to exit as soon as the
        entire song is loaded into the SOUND driver, and leave the song
        playing in the background.  This switch can only be used if the
        AdLib sound driver SOUND.COM was already loaded before SPUTROL was
        run.

  /Pnnn
        This switch allows selection of the disired output port.  The
        default port address is 388 hex.  No switch is required for
        either the AdLib or SoundBlaster cards.

  /Qn
        This switch is used to set the desired level of screen output.
                /Q0       display everything
                /Q1       display nothing
                /Q2       display errors only

  /Tn
        This switch can be used to change the default tempo of the song.

  /Vnnn
        This switch can be used to specify a single voice or list of voices
        to play.  /V246 would play only voices 2, 4 and 6.  This is most
        useful for proofreading music while creating ROL files, and
        hearing the balance between instruments.  It is also handy for
        determining which voice is playing a particular part for which
        you may want to change an instrument.

  ****************************************************************************

  This section describes the utility SPUTWAVE, which displays an 8-bit
  PCM sound file as a wave form on the screen.  An EGA display adapter
  or better is required and it supports the following syntax & switches:

        sputwave [<drive:>]<filename> [/On] [/Ln]

  /On
        N is a byte offset into file where display should start. 
  /Ln
        N is the length of data to display in bytes.  This number must
        be at least the pixel width of the current screen mode
        (usually 640), and must not be a value that would exceed the
        end of the file or a run-time error will occur.  The default data
        length displayed is 1 meg.

  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
  ----------------

  I'd like to thank the following people for their wonderful suggestions
  and help, without whom the SPUTTER Sound System would not be what it is
  today.

        Marty Peter, who first got me thinking about writing my own
        playback program, instead of relying on other player programs
        to play my custom sound files.  And for his great suggestion
        about a point-and-shoot interface that gave birth to the
        SPUTTER File Manager.

        Rich Wilson, for his suggestion of adding the BEEP event type to
        SPUTMON the Event Monitor, his suggestion to invoke playback from
        the DOS prompt, and for his support and friendship.

        Bernie Parent and Randy Bechtel, who's feedback made me realize
        the need to support the slower machines running at 4 and 8mhz.
        This prompted me to develop additional internal speaker drivers
        to support these machines.
        
        Tom Peters, for his sound clips and text files that mentioned the
        technique of resampling sound files.  This gave me the idea to
        implement the resampling algorithym, so that the playback rate
        of a soundfile can be changed so that it can be played on ANY
        speed machine.

        Dan Dubbs, for his suggestions to support the Sound Blaster,
        and AdLib music cards, the ability to spawn user defined programs
        and batch files from SPUTMON the Event Monitor, and offering many
        other neat suggestions.

        Bruce Tomlin, the author of SoundMaster for the Macintosh, for
        his help in locating the playback rate in Macintosh sound files.


                              Thank you all !!


  ---------------------------
  SPUTTER FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
  ---------------------------

  See the file FUTURE.TXT for a list of enhancements that I'm planning on
  implementing in future releases.


  ----------------------
  SOURCES OF SOUND FILES
  ----------------------

  Check out the Amiga & Macintosh conferences of your favorite BBS.
  These areas are usually chuck full of sound files.  Both types of files
  usually have the playback rate stored within the file.

  Some of my favorites are Exec-PC in Milwaukee WI at 414-789-4210 and
  Channel 1 in Cambridge MA at 617-354-8873.  I can always be reached
  on either of these systems.

  If you find an especially good source of sound files, let me know and
  I'll add it to this section, so others can enjoy them too.


  ----------------------
  SPEAKER OUTPUT QUALITY
  ----------------------

  If the output volume of your speaker is so low that you can't hear much,
  the solution is to attach an inexpensive amplified speaker similar to
  those sold by Radio Shack.  These usually have a volume control knob, and
  some also have a tone control knob.  Most run on batteries, and some can
  use an optional AC adapter.  All you need to do is attach the two wires
  from the external speaker to the two wires on the internal speaker, or
  you can attach mini jacks.

  For even better playback quality, you can purchase any of the Digital to
  Analog Converters available on the market.  Let me know if you have a board
  that Sputter doesn't already support, and I'll see about adding support for
  it.


  ------------
  REGISTRATION
  ------------

  You may use the SPUTTER Sound System free of charge for a period of
  10 days.  If after that period of time, you find it useful and
  continue to use it, a $25 registration fee is required.

  During this evaluation period, the SPUT and SPUTROL Player Utilities
  will display a shareware message and pause for a few seconds after 
  playback of each file.  

  When you register, you will receive your own registration number and
  instructions for unlocking the SPUTTER Sound System and removing this 
  message and delay.  You will also be able to unlock all future shareware
  releases of The SPUTTER Sound System.

  I always appreciate any feedback you might have about the SPUTTER Sound
  System, and would be interested in seeing any files that SPUTTER is not
  able to playback correctly.  You can either mail them to me, or upload
  them to one of the BBSs listed in the above sections.
