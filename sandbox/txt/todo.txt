* Softdisk GS Apple 2GS files have Icon files that have embedded icons. This program can view them: https://github.com/dmolony/DiskBrowser/blob/master/src/com/bytezone/diskbrowser/applefile/IconFile.java
  Doesn't look too complicated a format, could potentially convert the icons or maybe could get deark to add support for them

* Converting DOOM MUS files to MIDI works with the Slade program, but it's very buggy and always has been.
  It's open source code and runs on Linux, so consider using it's source code to build a custom CLI tool that converts .mus to .mid directly and reliably

* When DiscMaster was around, encountered several BitRock installers with this search: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=BitRock+Installer&qfields=content&formatid=xml
  These may be able to be extracted using: https://gist.github.com/mickael9/0b902da7c13207d1b86e

* Add support music/fuxoftAYLanguage and music/ayAMAD
  Ay_Emul can play both these, but it doesn't have CLI conversion supportso I could do either:
  1. Add CLI conversion support to Ay_Emul (see email about building it from svbulba@gmail.com)
  2. Patch ZXtune (which uses Ay_Emul) to support these formats
     If I do ZXTune, submit patch here: https://bitbucket.org/zxtune/zxtune/issues/150/ay-amad-support
     In EITHER CASE, make sure I'm using the latest versions of both the above before trying

* Take this 'xv' program that runs in Linux and make a CLI tool that leverages it's support of formats to convert to PNG
  https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/xv
  Specifically I want to convert image/yanagisawaPIC2 into PNG with: https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/xv/-/blob/master/xvpic2.c

* Get the IFF-RGFX datatype installed and working in vamos: http://aminet.net/package/util/dtype/RGFX-DT or http://aminet.net/package/util/dtype/RGFX-DT35
  Once it can view pictures, see about how I can convert into PNG, maybe with: https://aminet.net/package/gfx/conv/gfxcon
  Also see if I can add IFF YAFA support
  If either of the above fails, then add below to Low Priorty: Code my own image converter for IFF RGFX and IFF YAFA that leverages ancient to do unpacking of the data. See deark issues for more details.

* Add POVRAY rendering support, see the notes in povRay.js
  Example files: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/15720/Disk18.iso/ZIPS/POV@.EXE/POV
  Other POV files: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=pov&qfields=ext&family=text&dedup=dedup

* InstallShield cab extraction can be problematic as unshield doesn't work correctly with everything.
  For example CABS from: https://archive.org/details/250TCF
  They take up 653MB of space but only 62MB is extracted.
  Possible options: https://community.flexera.com/t5/InstallShield-Knowledge-Base/Installshield-Setup-exe-Command-Line-Parameters/ta-p/4270
  Or maybe try installing Install Shield authoring itself to see if I can open them or build an extractor or something:
	https://archive.org/details/install-shield-6.2-pro-std.-7z
	https://archive.org/details/installshield1150premier

* Get AARU support working: https://github.com/aaru-dps/Aaru
  https://archive.org/details/cd32-gamer-volume-11-1xcd		/Disc Dump/CD32_11.aaruf
  https://archive.org/details/cd32gamervolume91xcd			/Disc Dump/CD32Gamer9.dicf
  Then add that converter as an option to all formats that it supports

* Now that Print to File/PDF works better, should now be able to support:
  document/greenstreetPublisher (Open in win2k (or winxp) with Publishing Suite 99)

* Now that I emulate a real sound card with 86Box, I may be able to support music/famiTracker in winxp. See note

* ISOs I was unable to process:
	No idea what format this is in: https://archive.org/details/Royal_Tyrrell_Museum_Virtual_Tour_2003_WIN98
	These don't convert for some reason, they both appear to be Mac CDs
		https://archive.org/details/800_jeux_pour_mac		This one has an extra 16 bytes at front, removing it doesn't fix it, but did allow UniExtract to extract a TOAST partition, but couldn't process that at all either
		https://archive.org/details/Lex-C-RomSharewareExpress	no idea on this one
	Raw mac partition dumps:
		https://archive.org/details/apple-r-p-lib-internal-v-1.0

* See if I can detect and extract the compressed files in sandbox/fail/unsupportedCompression/*
  Maybe something from: https://www.sac.sk/files.php?d=7&l=

* It's possible that video/riffMultimediaMovie is actually a Director 3 Mac file already supported by ScummVM: https://discord.com/channels/350407629849493504/1033065501984817252/1038536366818086963
  This would entail creating a SCUMMVM based CLI tool to process these. See the comments in format/macromediaDirector.js

* Now that wine works and thus .NET and other vista/win7 programs work, try incorporating these programs into dexvert:
	reaConverter 7		https://www.reaconverter.com/		(see sandbox/app/reaConverter_formats.txt for format list. image/zbr can be converted to SVG with reaConverter)
	music/masterTracksPro: Using sandbox/app/master_tracks_pro_full.exe and S/N in email, could convert these to MIDI
	image/xRes: Using sandbox/app/xRes 3.0.iso
	*.DAX: Forgotten Realms Gold Box. "Gold Box Explorer" (sandbox/app/gbexplorer-1.2.zip) code from here: https://github.com/simeonpilgrim/goldboxexplorer	http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=dax&qfields=ext&family=unknown&sortBy=itemid
	Japanese Visual Novels: A variety of archive formats, many supported by this program: https://github.com/morkt/GARbro    Then reprocess: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/1123
	Stuffit Expander for Stuffit-X files might work in 64bit Vista? http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=sitx&qfields=ext&formatid=unknown
	SGS.DAT: Main DAT file from the Hyper Animation games. See sandbox/apps/DecomposeSGS		http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=sgs.dat&family=unknown

* Add OS/2 support by either using OS/2 Warp 4.5.2 (winworld) on 86Box or by using ArcaOS (was blue lion) in vbox/vmware: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utse8P_L8k0
  Then add format support for:
	archive/os2FTCOMP
	archive/os2InstallPackage
	archive/iconHeaven
	image/pmDraw
	document/os2Help	(https://hobbes.nmsu.edu/?path=%2Fpub%2Fos2%2Futil%2Fconvert)

* Add OS X support, running under tomsething like vbox/vmware.
  Then add programs:
	Graphic Converter (https://www.lemkesoft.de/en/products/graphicconverter/key-features/import-and-export-formats
	First test on my real mac to see if I can convert files via CLI (check PCX, AOL Art, etc) (see Help->CLI Commands)
	If CLI works then try getting it working in a virtual machine of some sort, something more portable than QEMU
	To run the supervisor.sh script on boot: https://www.karltarvas.com/2020/09/11/macos-run-script-on-startup.html
  Add format support:
	archive/sparseImage

* Add Classic MacOS support so the following can be supported:
	These seem to be Disk Copy 5/6, which I may be able to extract/convert with: http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/disk-copy-6
	  https://archive.org/details/GigaROM2.0.img
	  https://archive.org/details/InfoMac5Disk1.img
	  https://archive.org/details/InfoMac5Disk2.img

* Add RISC OS support, with one of these emulators:
	https://www.marutan.net/rpcemu/index.php
	http://arcem.sourceforge.net/
	http://b-em.bbcmicro.com/arculator/
	http://www.virtualacorn.co.uk/product.htm  (only runs on Windows)
	http://www.riscos.com/shop/products/106/index.htm  
  Will want to find CineWorks application and probably stick to version 3.x of RiscOS: https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/5/topics/248?page=2
  Then add support for:
	unsupported/audio/audioWorksSoundSample
	video/acornReplayVideo
  More samples from:
	https://archive.org/details/cine-clips
	https://archive.org/details/acorn_replay_collection
	https://archive.org/details/cdrom-riscos-clipart
	https://archive.org/details/cdrom-riscos-risc-disc-1

* Add DOS printing support to DOSBox with a patch from: https://sourceforge.net/p/dosbox/patches/?limit=250
  Once I have that I could support certain formats like:
	document/dartHypertext
	document/envisionPublisherDoc
	document/ibmStoryboardDocument

* Add Old 32bit Linux support then add (see notes for each format):
  music/beRoTracker
  music/synderSNG

* Create dexvert.com with a 'Browse' button that allows you to upload files to convert.
  Bonus points if I make a quick dirty 'dexvert.sh' bash script that folks can use that will convert via wget from CLI via dexvert.com
  WARNING! I need to assume that it will be exploited since I run so many programs, many of which likely have exploits.
  So I will want to research how to run programs within some sort of jailbreak, or leverage the docker image with multiple instances

* Add rendering of previews of full game maps supported by 'gamemap': https://github.com/Malvineous/libgamemaps
  Research them here: https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net

* Add 3D/Poly support. Can convert everything to GLTF/GLB format and use this viewer on the website: https://modelviewer.dev/
  Or use X3D instead?  https://cadexchanger.com/blog/3d-formats-overview-vrml-and-x3d/
  3DS is 3DS Max, so use that to convert things like: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/1268/Graphics%20Plus.iso/media/objects/3ds/ve_space/romulan.zip
  Software to convert DXF (and others) to GLB: https://github.com/assimp/assimp
  Other software that works with GLB: https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Project-Explorer/
  https://castle-engine.io/view3dscene.php
  Converting Shockwave 3D files: https://github.com/tomysshadow/Shockwave-3D-World-Converter
  https://cadexchanger.com/contact-us/licensing-inquiry/#requestFormSection
- Over 8,000 lightWave3DScenes that have not been properly identified yet : http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=LWSC&qfields=content&family=text&formatid=txt
- For THUMBNAILS of polys, just a PNG screenshot, but with a line/globe/3d model looking icon in the bottom right corner of the thumbnail
- Ray Dream Studio 5.5 works ok on Windows XP and loaded some sample RDS files I tried: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/16286/Ray%20Dream%20Studio%205.5%20(MetaCreations)(1999).iso/pc
  It has multiple export options. Make sure files get the .rds extension, without it they wouldn't open (http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/16284/Ray%20Dream%20Studio%20(CDRAYD1)%20(Ray%20Dream)%20(1995).iso/Dream%20Models/Lifeform/PENGUIN)
- Add support for VRML. Possible renderers: https://github.com/castle-engine/view3dscene, Blender, Blaxxun Contact 4.4
  Would love have it be interactive in the browser. See the 3D/Poly support note below:
- Would be great if on the 'browse' page each model could be viewed inline in a small thumbnail sized interactive viewer. Though this may be too intensive? Maybe generate thumbs for each one, as we do for images and show the thumbs instead
  For a Before/After screenshot, can use search results: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=3dmf&itemid=9374
- Then use this doom2vrml program to make doom levels browseable: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/6095/WIN95_09962.iso/vrml/dm2v-10.zip  or  http://www.ocnus.com/doom.html
  Then reply to tweet: https://twitter.com/senn_twt/status/1591342713739288576?s=12&t=Y840vTjzTkojj8W_7FWPNw
- Would be amazing if other levels (Hexen, Heretic, Unreal, Wolfenstein 3D, Quake, etc) were flyable too
- Would also be cool if it could convert and render entire levels liek Warcraft maps, warcraft 3 maps, doom, hexen, quake and valve maps, etc
- poly/rayDreamDesignerScene openable in Corel Draw 7?
- Add support for this 3D format: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/2020/The%20640%20Meg%20Shareware%20Studio%20CD-ROM%20Volume%20II%20(Data%20Exo)(1993).ISO/graphics/3d25.zip

* Pay someone to add more formats to FFMPEG (gl/dl/ANIM/etc) or to improve existing formats: http://www.ffmpeg.org/consulting.html

/----------------\
| Probably Never |

* Consider switching away from DOSBOX and use an authentic MS-DOS installation under 86Box
   Pro: Compatability with some dexvert/dos/* programs that didn't work under dosbox (of which I don't know of any). Feels cleaner.
  Cons: Would need to solve video recording & keyboard control (both of which I wrote custom code patches to DOSBOX to implement)
  I could maybe add similar code to 86Box, but that would be harder to control from 'within' dos.
  It's probably not worth doing since I can't think of many 'benefits' and what I have with DOSBox "works ok"

* Add 3DO support. Ideally via mount using dexvert/sandbox/app/operafs but I'd need to update that code to compile against modern linux kernel
  Other 3DO extractor programs: https://forum.uqm.stack.nl/index.php?topic=3535.0
  Some additional OperaFS programs: http://altmer.arts-union.ru/3DO/3do_utils.htm

* Try and get support added to linux kernel for mounting CDI images. Seems like a tall order.
  Could ask on IRC OFTC #kernelnewbies and ##linux on freenode about where I could find someone who could do this, and maybe pay them to do it
  https://www.isobuster.com/help/cd-i_and_vcd
  https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Green+Book+CD-ROM
  https://www.lscdweb.com/data/downloadables/2/8/cdi_may94_r2.pdf
  See some tools in sandbox/app/CD-i Image Decoding Tools rhdn.zip
  Additional tools for CD-I from here (including animation stuff): https://archive.org/details/various.cd-i.utilities.3.5hd.os9

* Create native C nodejs module for imagemagick/recoil and other libs (abydos, etc) for speed. Example existing image magick one: https://github.com/elad/node-imagemagick-native

* Convert bitmap fonts to more usable vector fonts by trying to "autotrace" the fonts, or utilize a pro tool like: https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/bitfonter/   or   https://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/transtype/
