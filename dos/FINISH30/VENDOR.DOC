                  DISTRIBUTING IMAGISOFT'S SHAREWARE PRODUCTS

    Anyone distributing ImagiSOFT's Shareware Products for any kind of

       Distributors who state or imply that users are getting anything more

    Award winning MOVIES TO GO! is a superb program for finding out answers
    to trivia quizzes, cataloging your own video or CD collection, or
    uncovering the perfect video for your present mood.  The shareware
    version provides a wealth of information on over 1,000 movies.
    Detailed reviews include the actors, directors, year, setting,
    characters, writers, possible objectionable content, music, MPAA
    rating, and box office gross.  Search for just about anything:
    comedies, drama, sports, family, Dog Movies, World War II, Family
    Relationships, Robin Hood, Knights, Halloween, Disney Movies, Horses,
    etc.  It  uses a hypertext search engine so simply clicking on a
    subject will initiate a search for all other references.

    The stunning graphics interface makes this program a delight to use.
    Each movie's information is attractively displayed on the "Now Showing
    Screen" with icons depicting drama, comedy, the MPAA rating, and the
    reviewer's rating.  The animated icons make fun sounds; for example,
    after you press the help button a school teacher writes on a chalk
    board.  This program is an absolute must for the movie buff!  The
    registered version has information on over 8,000 films, to which
    ImagiSOFT adds 200 - 300 each month.

    The Color Wizard is far more than just another children's coloring book
    program. The advanced technology of this software allows you to choose
    from a palate of over 700 different colors and color blends.  It's
    educational too!  Press the storybook icon to read about each picture
    and press the artist icon to watch the artist paint the picture right
    before your eyes.  Our professional artists will teach you about
    perspective, color, value, light, reflections, and shadows.  You will
    amaze yourself at the fine pictures you can create after just a few
    moments!  The Color Wizard has eight pictures for you to color from
    their collection of Dinosaurs, Sharks, Aesop's Fables, and Rapunzel.

    "Calling Color Wizard a coloring book for kids is a little like
    dismissing the ceiling of the Sistine chapel as a remodeling job...
    Even if your children already have 4 or 5 coloring book programs,
    you'll want to add Color Wizard to your collection as an upgrade that
    will challenge their abilities and entertain them for hours."

    Like chess in Europe, Wari (also known as Mancala and Ourri) is
    Africa's foremost strategy game.  It was popular 4,000 years ago with
    the pharaohs of Egypt and until recently, was restricted to African
    royalty.  This two-player strategy game is deceptively easy to learn,
    but may take a lifetime to master.  Play another person or against one
    of the computer's three skill levels.  Wari's beautiful graphics,
    animation, background music and sound clips greatly add to the
    enjoyment in playing this game.  The animated tutorial will teach you
    the rules and winning strategies.  Requires VGA graphics, DOS or
    Windows, and 640K. Soundblaster and mouse recommended.

    Software developers distribute THE FINISHING TOUCH as the installation
    portion of their software. It saves developers money in two ways:
        1) by reducing customer support calls
        2) by compressing files more than 50%, thus cutting the number of
           distribution disks in half

    It checks hardware, modifies AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS, prints or
    views ASCII files, does error checking, and more!  Supports English,
    French, German, Dutch, Norwegian and Spanish languages. Includes 67
    pages of documentation. It can also be used as a software update
    program. Registered version takes up less than 35K of disk space. The
    $69.95 registration fee allows a company to distribute as many copies,
    and as many different products of their software using the FINISHING
    TOUCH as they want to--no further royalties are required.
