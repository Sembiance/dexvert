* I now have a package for grok which decodes JPEG2000 images: https://github.com/GrokImageCompression/grok/wiki/2.-grk_decompress
  So create a program for it and add it to jpeg2000 format

* Test abydosconvert with JPEG XL images
  Also I added grok support, so test it with JPEG2000 images

* New recoil formats (maybe can find examples on sourceforge issues/mailing list?):
MSX2	MIF	MSX Interchange Format	up to 512x424		1 or 2
Atari ST/STE	COL	Atari Image Manager	up to 256x256	16777216 colors	1
Atari ST/STE	IM	Atari Image Manager	up to 256x256	256-level grayscale	1
Atari ST/STE	GRX	Grafix			1
Atari Falcon	BP6, BP8, C06, C08, C16, C24, C32	UIMG			1

* Updated 'ancient' compressor formats:
Compact (Unix)
Compress (Unix)
Freeze (Unix)
LOB Compressor a.k.a. multipac. all 6 modes (Atari)
Pack (Unix)
Quasijarus Strong compression (FreeBSD)
PX20 support - fast bypass of passwords (Amiga)
DMS improvements for broken files - auto fixup (Amiga)
XPK PPMQ (This concludes XPK, yay!) (Amiga)
SCO Compress LZH (Unix)

* Deark updated from 1.6.3_p20221118 to 1.6.5_p20230926   (diff formats.txt? https://github.com/jsummers/deark)

* drxtract updated from 2021-08-07 to 2023-08-16

* PeaZip supports lie 234 formats but I'm only using it for 1. Look to extend that support: https://github.com/peazip/PeaZip

* Remove the temporary symlink /usr/lib64/libtiff.so.5 (from dexvert)
  Re-do the environment for bin/zztScreenshotter as it currently links to libtiff.so.5 which isn't installed

* There is a bug in DebLab/app/uniso.js --hfs --macEncoding=japan MACUSER-MACBIN40A-1997-03.ISO out
From this ISO:
http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/10406
https://archive.org/details/macuser-macbin40-1997-03
If you `hcdi 2403` and then do `hls -albi` you will see messed up entry for Music.DAT.1
This is because the creator code is 'KS2\r' instead of 'KS2 ' and the carriage return screws up the output causing uniso.js to fail
I can add code to hfsutils in show_long() in hls.c that will write a char safeCreator[5]; and safeType[5] char by char and only copying over printable ASCII values otherwise specifying '?' and then using that below for both the type and creator

* Ensure all the files from these CDs convert properly:
iso/Digital Magazine for Photography - Gallery
iso/Sexual Girls in Magical World
iso/Natsu Nice Gal Summary '94
iso/Love Bytes

* I downloaded Abydos test suite v3. I should b3sum remove any files that I alread have samples for and add support for all new ones
  It's in: sandbox/samples/abydos-testsuite-3.tar.xz  downloaded from: http://snisurset.net/download.php?d=abydos

* Upload all packages in dexvert to latest versions

* Look into adopting KeyView Pro as more conversion software. See: https://archive.org/details/KeyViewPro

* Now that I'm not using QEMU, maybe I can get certain formats working:
 greenstreetPublisher
 zbr

* Look at the various 'notes' fields in all the formats to see if additional/improved support can be added

/---------------\
| High Priority |
\---------------/
* Add support music/fuxoftAYLanguage and music/ayAMAD
  Ay_Emul can play both these, but it doesn't have CLI conversion supportso I could do either:
  1. Add CLI conversion support (see email about building it from svbulba@gmail.com)
  2. Patch ZXtune (which uses Ay_Emul) to support these formats
  If I do ZXTune, submit patch here: https://bitbucket.org/zxtune/zxtune/issues/150/ay-amad-support
  In EITHER CASE, make sure I'm using the latest versions of both the above before trying

* See about installing Director 5 under WINDOWS 2000 and see if I can open Director 5 files: https://winworldpc.com/product/director/50  or  https://archive.org/details/dirarchive
  https://discord.com/channels/350407629849493504/1033065501984817252/1041666797247664139

  Also see if I can do some of the director 3 mac files? https://discord.com/channels/350407629849493504/1033065501984817252/1038536366818086963
  Afterwards, reprocess #10348 and potentially other Mac CDs
  This might help processing Director 5 files, maybe it can make them editable in new director: https://github.com/ProjectorRays/ProjectorRays

* Consider adding 'Detect-It-Easy' as an identifier: https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy

* Improve recombining of PICT images in deark, some are not doing it properly:
  Start with:  â€¢ Figure 5 Window in List Mode.pict
  Then do pict/01 (which also needs to convert from .qtif to .png) (After this is done, probably remove the )

* Add 3D/Poly support. Can convert everything to GLTF/GLB format and use this viewer on the website: https://modelviewer.dev/
  Or use X3D instead?  https://cadexchanger.com/blog/3d-formats-overview-vrml-and-x3d/
  3DS is 3DS Max, so use that to convert things like: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/1268/Graphics%20Plus.iso/media/objects/3ds/ve_space/romulan.zip
  Software to convert DXF (and others) to GLB: https://github.com/assimp/assimp
  Other software that works with GLB: https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Project-Explorer/
  https://castle-engine.io/view3dscene.php
  Converting Shockwave 3D files: https://github.com/tomysshadow/Shockwave-3D-World-Converter
  https://cadexchanger.com/contact-us/licensing-inquiry/#requestFormSection
* Over 8,000 lightWave3DScenes that have not been properly identified yet (discmaster needs to do a re-scan): http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=LWSC&qfields=content&family=text&formatid=txt
* For THUMBNAILS of polys, just a PNG screenshot, but with a line/globe/3d model looking icon in the bottom right corner of the thumbnail
* Ray Dream Studio 5.5 works ok on Windows XP and loaded some sample RDS files I tried: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/16286/Ray%20Dream%20Studio%205.5%20(MetaCreations)(1999).iso/pc
  It has multiple export options. Make sure files get the .rds extension, without it they wouldn't open (http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/16284/Ray%20Dream%20Studio%20(CDRAYD1)%20(Ray%20Dream)%20(1995).iso/Dream%20Models/Lifeform/PENGUIN)
* Add support for VRML. Possible renderers: https://github.com/castle-engine/view3dscene, Blender, Blaxxun Contact 4.4
  Would love have it be interactive in the browser. See the 3D/Poly support note below:
* Would be great if on the 'browse' page each model could be viewed inline in a small thumbnail sized interactive viewer. Though this may be too intensive? Maybe generate thumbs for each one, as we do for images and show the thumbs instead
  For a Before/After screenshot, can use search results: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=3dmf&itemid=9374
* Then use this doom2vrml program to make doom levels browseable: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/6095/WIN95_09962.iso/vrml/dm2v-10.zip  or  http://www.ocnus.com/doom.html
  Then reply to tweet: https://twitter.com/senn_twt/status/1591342713739288576?s=12&t=Y840vTjzTkojj8W_7FWPNw
* Would be amazing if other levels (Hexen, Heretic, Unreal, Wolfenstein 3D, Quake, etc) were flyable too!
* Would also be cool if it could convert and render entire levels liek Warcraft maps, warcraft 3 maps, doom, hexen, quake and valve maps, etc
* poly/rayDreamDesignerScene openable in Corel Draw 7?
* Add support for this 3D format: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/2020/The%20640%20Meg%20Shareware%20Studio%20CD-ROM%20Volume%20II%20(Data%20Exo)(1993).ISO/graphics/3d25.zip

  From twitter user: https://twitter.com/Skyplayer37/status/1593440006261321729?s=20&t=ZJ4V5KTiA_rfV0YHnjJdYg

* Add rendering of maps supported by 'gamemap': https://github.com/Malvineous/libgamemaps
  Research them here: https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net

* Get AARU support working: https://github.com/aaru-dps/Aaru
  http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/4313/Disc%20Dump/CD32_11.aaruf
  http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/4314/Disc%20Dump/CD32Gamer9.dicf
  Then add that converter as an option to all formats that it supports

* Once debby adds a way to leverage SCUMMVM to extract Director 3 files: https://discord.com/channels/350407629849493504/1033065501984817252/1038538531905208340
  Then process some of those files.
  Someone may be rigging up SCUMMVM to extract .MMM assets: https://discord.com/channels/350407629849493504/1033065501984817252/1038559070258462760
  Once they do that, add support for this to dexvert and then reprocess those formats. Will want to delete the video/riffMultimediaMovie format and come up with a new archive/director3RIFFMMM

  Using: https://gist.github.com/mickael9/0b902da7c13207d1b86e

* Creating a Vista SP2 64bit OS image would allow running DotNet programs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/get-started/system-requirements
  This ability would allow conversion/extraction of several additional formats:
	*.DAX: Forgotten Realms Gold Box. "Gold Box Explorer" (sandbox/app/gbexplorer-1.2.zip) code from here: https://github.com/simeonpilgrim/goldboxexplorer	http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=dax&qfields=ext&family=unknown&sortBy=itemid
	SGS.DAT: Main DAT file from the Hyper Animation games. See sandbox/apps/DecomposeSGS		http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=sgs.dat&family=unknown
	image/xRes: Using sandbox/app/xRes 3.0.iso  it didn't run in Win2k/WinXP, but might? run under Vista. Only encountered on 1 CD so far
	music/masterTracksPro: Using sandbox/app/master_tracks_pro_full.exe and S/N in email, could convert these to MIDI
	Japanese Visual Novels: A variety of archive formats, many supported by this program: https://github.com/morkt/GARbro    Then reprocess: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/1123
	Konverter can support lots of formats: https://www.logipole.com/konvertor-en.htm
	Stuffit Expander for Stuffit-X files might work in 64bit Vista? http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=sitx&qfields=ext&formatid=unknown

* Add POVRAY rendering support, see the notes in povRay.js
  Example files: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/15720/Disk18.iso/ZIPS/POV@.EXE/POV
  Other POV files: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=pov&qfields=ext&family=text&dedup=dedup

	These don't convert for some reason, they both appear to be Mac CDs
		https://archive.org/details/800_jeux_pour_mac		This one has an extra 16 bytes at front, removing it doesn't fix it, but did allow UniExtract to extract a TOAST partition, but couldn't process that at all either

* See if I can extract and of the compression I encountered in sandbox/unknownCompression (maybe try: https://www.sac.sk/files.php?d=7&l=)
  Any I add, will need to do a search of unknown files HTML to find that magic

* Add this as an additional decrypter for Macromedia shockwave files, potentially as the first decrypter: https://github.com/ProjectorRays/ProjectorRays

* See if I could handle extraction of TEXT data better from certain director files:
  http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/4274/CD-Rom%20now%20n.21.iso/director/stones.dir/00025_Field_25.txt
  If I improve it, reply here: https://discord.com/channels/350407629849493504/1033065501984817252/1044841211090960424

* Once recoil has PIC2 support, enable it in src/format/image/yanagisawaPIC2.js  and then reprocess:

* Could create a new garbage detector with this, not sure it would be better or not: https://liner.ai/

* Get the IFF-RGFX datatype installed and working on my Amiga:http://aminet.net/package/util/dtype/RGFX-DT or http://aminet.net/package/util/dtype/RGFX-DT35
  Once it can view pictures, see about how I can convert into PNG, maybe with: https://aminet.net/package/gfx/conv/gfxcon
  Also see if I can add IFF YAFA support
  If either of the above fails, then add to Low Priorty: Code my own image converter for IFF RGFX and IFF YAFA that leverages ancient to do unpacking of the data. See deark issues for more details.

* InstallShield cab extraction can be problematic as unshield doesn't work correctly with everything. For example: This doesn't extract right: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/2673/250_TCF.iso
Try these params: https://community.flexera.com/t5/InstallShield-Knowledge-Base/Installshield-Setup-exe-Command-Line-Parameters/ta-p/4270
Also try loading up installshield itself and see if I can open them or something:
https://archive.org/details/install-shield-6.2-pro-std.-7z
https://archive.org/details/installshield1150premier

* Find a converter/decompiler for applesoft BASIC. Maybe I can use: https://github.com/AppleCommander/AppleCommander/search?q=Applesoft

* Add OS/2 support by using ArcaOS (was blue lion): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utse8P_L8k0
  Then add format support for:
	archive/os2FTCOMP
	archive/os2InstallPackage
	archive/iconHeaven
	image/pmDraw
	document/os2Help	(https://hobbes.nmsu.edu/?path=%2Fpub%2Fos2%2Futil%2Fconvert)
	and others (see unsupported notes). Then re-process any CD's that have those formats on them (#570, etc)

* Create a deno based parser that can parse text/imf internet message format, internet e-mail/news formats to verify that they are indeed valid files. Bonus points for converting HTML based emails into .html documents
  http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Internet_e-mail_message_format
  See samples in: sandbox/samples/mail_news/

* If deark adds better IFF IMAG support, re-process: 265 301 313 356 357 406 481 510 517 518 519 520 607 614 615 629 731 732 766 790 921 969
  Ideally this search should return 321+ matches:

* Once I can find later versions of Asymetrix Toolbook (aka Multimedia ToolBook), use it to extract files from .tbk files
  Note, quite possibly will need a seperate version for every possible versioned TBK file.
  I tried ToolBook 3.0 (from winworld) on a photos.tbk and it said it needed a later version.
  The only other copy I could find is on eBay, version 4.0 which I ordered is and is coming

* Add soundtrakker 128 support: http://justsolve.archiveteam.org/wiki/Soundtrakker_128_module
No known linux/windows players?

	Reprocess:
	  #10632
	  Acorn Replay videos (#625 CineClips) http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/625
	  ArtWorks ClipArt 1
  	Will want to find CineWorks application and probably stick to version 3.x of RiscOS: https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/5/topics/248?page=2
	also:
	  (unsupported/audio/audioWorksSoundSample)
	After added, register rated 4 items: Archive Magazine, Archimedes *, ARM Club, APDL*, Archimedes, RISCafe
	Including re-registering manually on command line: /mnt/retromission/ia/3/327a4eeb2a6d94439c0d09d381255cabbf223e06

* Create an extractor for the embedded images and audio within a Microsoft Agent Character (other/microsoftAgentCharacter)
  Full file format details available in sandbox/wip/MSAgentDataSpecification_v1_4.htm
  Bonus points if I actually animate the character in a couple poses/animations into an animated GIF/movie

* GoADF 4.0 will add support for mounting an ADF file via an arexx port. Add this to adfOFS and adfFFS when added: http://www.bitplan.pl/goadf/download.html

* Add 3DO support. Ideally via mount using dexvert/sandbox/app/operafs but I'd need to update that code to compile against modern linux kernel
  Other 3Do extractor programs: https://forum.uqm.stack.nl/index.php?topic=3535.0
  Some additional OperaFS programs: http://altmer.arts-union.ru/3DO/3do_utils.htm

* Add sparseimage conversion support (requires MacOS X, see archive/sparseImage notes)

* Could add printer support to DOSBox: https://sourceforge.net/p/dosbox/patches/?limit=250
  Then I could 'print' certain things, like EnvisionPublisher documents (look for others)

* Support ANSI Music files: http://artscene.textfiles.com/ansimusic/

* Softdisk GS Apple 2GS files have Icon files that have embedded icons. This program can view them: https://github.com/dmolony/DiskBrowser/blob/master/src/com/bytezone/diskbrowser/applefile/IconFile.java
  Doesn't look too complicated a format, could potentially convert the icons or maybe could get deark to add support for them

* Add Graphic Converter OS X (https://www.lemkesoft.de/en/products/graphicconverter/key-features/import-and-export-formats) to my Mac Mini OSX and test CLI to convert PCX (see Help->CLI Commands)
  If that works, for OSX: https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM or https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM or https://www.emaculation.com/doku.php/ppc-osx-on-qemu-for-windows
  For the OpenBoo.sh script, just reference that and run my own command line script. See the qemu.txt doc for a link to update CLI args
  To run the supervisor.sh script on boot: https://www.karltarvas.com/2020/09/11/macos-run-script-on-startup.html

* Create dexvert.com with a 'Browse' button that allows you to upload files including a REST API
  WARNING! I need to assumed that it will be exploited. So I will want to run dexvert on virtual machines. Not sure if I can run virtual machines like windows from WITHIN a virtual machine running gentoo+dexvert.... hrm...

* Might be fun to try and "run" any windows .scr screensavers in wine and record the output into a preview.mp4 video

* Consider switching away from DOSBOX and use an authentic MS-DOS installation under 86Box
  Pro: Compatability, including with certain dexvert/dos/* programs that didn't work under dosbox. Feels cleaner.
  Cons: Would need to solve video recording and keyboard control (both of which I wrote custom code patches to DOSBOX to implement)
  I could maybe add similar code to 86Box, but that would be harder to control from 'within' dos. Would need to give this some thought

* Try and get support added to linux kernel for mounting CDI images. Seems like a tall order.
  Could ask on IRC OFTC #kernelnewbies and ##linux on freenode about where I could find someone who could do this, and maybe pay them to do it

  https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Green+Book+CD-ROM
  https://www.lscdweb.com/data/downloadables/2/8/cdi_may94_r2.pdf
  See some tools in sandbox/app/CD-i Image Decoding Tools rhdn.zip

* Create native C nodejs module for imagemagick/recoil and other libs (abydos, etc) for speed. Example existing image magick one: https://github.com/elad/node-imagemagick-native

* Convert bitmap fonts to more usable vector fonts by trying to "autotrace" the fonts, or utilize a pro tool like: https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/bitfonter/   or   https://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/transtype/
