WORDSTAR PHANTOM SPACE

    Phantom space is unique to
WordStar: there is no direct
translation available in other word
processors.

    This parameter defines a
character to insert in a translated
document when a Phantom Space is
encountered in the WordStar
original.

    Enter the Hex-ASCII
representation of the desired
character, and press RETURN.

Default: 53 ("S")
