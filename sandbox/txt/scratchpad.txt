* See if I can get xeyes working with a virtualX display

* See if I can reproduce the problem with multiple running at once in runUtil

* Fix that problem, then test multiple runnings of testdexvert --format=image/threeDCK and get the dosUtil problem fixed

Some file locking code for xvfb 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30332137/xvfb-run-unreliable-when-multiple-instances-invoked-in-parallel

May just need to do a waitUntil I see the x11 lock file appear before starting the process 
Should also inspect this file, see what it has in it if there is further verification I can do

Look at more Xvfb options

Test the testdexvert with the threeDCK and comment OUT the xu.stdout calls, see if that fixes the missing input
