
    *********************** REGISTRATION BENEFITS *************************

    You receive the following: (See the file ORDER.FRM for an order form)

    1.   The  latest  version of  CRUSH, without the "Teaser"  Registration
         banner. This reduces the size of CRUSH.EXE by about 1k.

    2.   The  additional programs UNDO.EXE and UNDO2.EXE which provide tiny
         alternatives  to UNCRUSH.EXE  for unpacking an uncompressed  CRUSH
         archive.  UNDO.EXE  is  3.8k  and  ignores any  path  information.
         UNDO2.EXE is 4.3k and will also re-construct embedded paths. These
         programs  can be included  within distribution archives that  hold
         CRUSH  archives,  providing the  smallest package that will  allow
         UNCRUSHing without additional programs. Ideally UNDO.EXE and a CRU
         archive could be embedded inside an SFX archive.

    3.   A  disk  copy of  the  full manual as ASCII text,  PostScript  and
         Laserjet format, suitable for direct printing.

    4.   The  user will receive support by CIS mail or post for the program
         for 2 years after the registration date.

    5.   1 free upgrade to later versions, as available (small S&H charge).

    Distribution Licence:  CRUSH  can  be used for distributing  compressed
         files (but not CRUSH.EXE). This allows limitless distribution.

    Office Licence: This entitles the program to be shared between up to 15
         non-networked machines within one office. Further machines require
         additional Office licences, or extra Single user licences.

    Network Licence: This entitles the program to be shared on a network of
         up  to  30 workstations.  Networks with more than 30  workstations
         require multiple Network licences, or the site licence (below).

    Site Licence:  The basic site licence entitles the program to be shared
         by  up to 100 employees from one company on one site, where a site
         consists  of a single plot of land with one or more buildings.  If
         the  licence is required for  more than 100 employees, then  extra
         site licences need to be purchased until each employee is covered.

    Users  requiring multiple licences  can negotiate with us directly  via
    one  of:  e-mail,  voice  phone  or address, as detailed  in  the  file
    VENDINFO.DIZ.
