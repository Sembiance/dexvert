Note: we are working on ESP v2.0, and we hope the first betas will be
      relased soon...
Some important features of ESP v2.0:
  - DLL-support for easy upgrade
  - characterized graphic user interface (archiver shell) like RAR or ACE
  - all archiver function (add, delete, move, update, etc...)
  - better ratio, higher speed and super multimedia compression algorithms
  - long filename and extended attribute/date support (Win95,OS/2,Linux)
  - free UNESP source code in Assembly, BAssPasC, Pascal and C/C++ language!
  - LINUX version of ESP (and maybe Win95 and OS/2 too)
  - realtime-interpreted ANSI comments, and FLI/FLC comments!
  - 7-bit file formats (UUE or Code91 encoding)

                            WHAT'S NEW?

 v1.92 final version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Modifications in text files, German manual is complete now. <by Roman Korcek>
- Some internet address and BBS has changed, see manuals!
- DOSNAVIG.TXT is renamed to DOSSHELL.TXT and it contains informations about
  using ESP with Volkov Commander v4.99+ too. <by Boogie>
- bugfix in ESPLINK: name changed from SINGE.ESP to SINGLE.ESP
- bigfix in ESP:  ESP test \path\mask  didn't work!  <thanks to Johnson Wu>

 v1.91 test version    NOT RELASED BY US!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New option is added to ESP:
    /MLx  where x is the 'minimum match length' in range [3..256] (default=3).
  For multimedia files use both /MM (or /MM2) and /MLx options!
  (Value /ML7 was the best in my tests)           <idea by Szymon Grabowski>
- Small modification in compress routine in order to presenting better ratio
  with /M0 and /M2 (/M1 and /M3 are unchanged).

 v1.9 final version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- All known bugs are fixed!!!
  If you find a bug in this version, please report immediately!
- Slovakian documentation, and corrections in other texts by Roman Korcek
- PROGRAMS.TXT added, this is a list of programs which supports ESP archiver
- DOSNAVIG.TXT added, instructions for using ESP with Dos navigator

 v1.9 non-public beta7 version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New multimedia-compression algorithm by Szymon Grabowski
  Use /MM2 option for compress 24-bit files better than other archivers!
  It works only with uncompressed files, for example: RAW, BMP, TGA, TIFF
  Warning! JPG and PNG is already compressed, don't try compress them with /MM2
- ESP.EXE supports listfile, you can specify listfile-name after a @ character:
   ESP archive.ESP @listfile
  Warning! If you want use directory names in the listfile, you must use
  /P (or /R) option too, otherwise ESP don't store path for files!
- ESP & UNESP give back ERRORLEVEL values if (de)compress failed  <Beef&Piszur>

 v1.9 non-public beta6 version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- OS/2 bug fixed. <Special thanks to Kov cs Istv n (Kofa) for the lot of help!>
    When launching an ESP SFX with archive comment present as the first
    program in a DOS session the SFX would hang at the beginning of extraction
    if the full path of the executable file is 28 characters or longer.
- BUGFIX: there was an other optimization bug, so UNESP failed to extract
  some large and very special files correctly  <thanks to Beef & Piszur>
- BUGFIX: Sometimes SFX modules crash after unpack all file. <thanks to P lma>
- BUGFIX: UNESP and SFX-modules didn't write error if disk full. <Beef&Piszur>
- ESP write the archive-name, number of files and uncompressed size.  <Piszur>
- UNESP: You can abort listing with ESC key (UNESP LK archive)   <Beef&Piszur>
- ESP: You can write the options after filename(s) too.          <Beef&Piszur>
- New: n*1000byte and n*1000000byte volume sizes added:
    /Vnnn  =  if nnn>=4096 then nnn bytes, else nnn*1024 bytes!
    /Vnnnk =  nnn*1000 bytes
    /VnnnK =  nnn*1024 bytes
    /Vnnnm =  nnn*1,000,000 bytes  (million bytes)
    /VnnnM =  nnn*1024*1024 bytes  (megabytes)
  Special volume sizes for MS-DOS formatted diskettes: (ARJ-compatible)
    /VV1440  = 1456400 byte
    /VV1200  = 1212400 byte
    /VV720   =  729400 byte
    /VV360   =  361400 byte
  <Thanks to Beef & Piszur for all ideas!>
- And some other small bugfixes...


 v1.9 beta5 test version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- BUGFIX: UNESP cannot unpack archives with more than 256 files sometimes!
- BUGFIX: In previous versions you can use two password to extract files!
  For example: If you encrypt an archive with password ABCD, then you can unpack
  it with password ABCE too. But ABCC or ABCF don't works!!! The lowest bit
  of ASCII code lost in short passwords. <thanks to Pedro Ignacio Maza Arias>
  I must add new switch for reverse compatibility: /MEx
  Default is new algorithm, but you can make compatible encrypted archives
  if you use /ME1 option. (for new algorithm /ME2, but this is default, so
  switch not need) In version 2.0 will be more encryption method, including
  PGP and others. Older versions cannot unpack /ME2-encrypted archives!!!
- BUGFIX: UNESP create subdirs wrong if you gave destination path.
- BUGFIX: Method /M0 and /M1 are modified, because /M0 didn't works on all
  Pentium-compatible processors <thanks to Beef&Piszur>
- BUGFIX: REP-search function works bad sometimes, if the files are smaller
  than 32 byte! <thanks to Pierre Foucart>
- NEW: ESP save full path if you give, and works with /R too!
  For example: ESP /R ARCHIVE.ESP F:\ASSEMBLY\ESP\*.ASM DOC\MANUAL.* D:*.*
- NEW: If you give a subdir's name, then ESP will automatic append '\*.*'
  example: ESP ARCHIVE.ESP TESTDIR  equal with  ESP ARCHIVE.ESP TESTDIR\*.*
     <idea from Grin and others>
- NEW: ESP write size and ratio of redudancy after compression
- NEW: UNESP write actual ratio under testing <idea by Beef&Piszur>
- NEW in UNESP: You can give more filename/filemask in command line
      <idea by George Shadoff>
- NEW in UNESP: You can use LISTFILE too. Example: UNESP X ARCH.ESP @LIST.TXT
  In listfile you can use SPACE,#0,CR or LF between filenames/filemasks!
- NEW: Comment graphic in 640x480 too!  <idea from Johnson Wu>
  ESP supports comment GFX in resolution 320x200 or 640x480, with 2,16 or 256
  colors! (VESA-compatible VGA-card need for view 640x480x256 gfx)
  Use GIF2PIC converter for create PIC file, and after you can add picture
  to archive with /C5 or /C6 option!
  (RAW2PIC util is removed from package)
