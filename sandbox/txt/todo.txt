* Add the .mix format (READ VERY CAREFULLY! 3 different .mix formats, some of which I may already support!):
    https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/2023/12/29/picture-it/
	http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/MIX_(Picture_It!)
	https://archive.org/details/microsoft_graphics_studio_-_picture_it_99

* Add support for: http://justsolve.archiveteam.org/wiki/InstallIt!

* Create a util/openVNCWindows.js <host> that will dynamically determine how to open all the VNC windows
  Probably update wine and os to record down in a ram dexvert file which VNC ports are being listened on
  If host is omitted or is localhost then open locally.
  If host is a remote host then use vncRemote command

* See if I can handle these: https://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/1312/Neurodancer.iso/PCND16.MMM

* Ensure the games mentioned here I support extract the graphics from: https://strangecomforts.com/the-strange-world-of-japans-pc-98-computer/
* Look into various 'Visual Novel' formats. See discmaster search: http://iadl.retromission.com/items?collectionid=cd-roms&collectionid=cdrom_contributions&collectionid=cdromimages&collectionid=cdromsoftware&collectionid=%40asromix&collectionid=%40gingerbeardman&collectionid=%40iamxray&collectionid=%40pascal_of_irate&collectionid=%40sembiance&collectionid=%40shivashaw&collectionid=adultcdroms&collectionid=ftpsites&collectionid=softwarecapsules&collectionid=softwarelibrary_mature&subject=visual%20novel&title=&priority=999&minfiles=0&maxfiles=0&minsize=0&maxsize=0&limit=1000
  Would use this program (vista required, so hopefully works with wine) to convert: https://github.com/morkt/GARbro

/---------------\
| High Priority |
\---------------/
* Softdisk GS Apple 2GS files have Icon files that have embedded icons. This program can view them: https://github.com/dmolony/DiskBrowser/blob/master/src/com/bytezone/diskbrowser/applefile/IconFile.java
  Doesn't look too complicated a format, could potentially convert the icons or maybe could get deark to add support for them

* Track down a better, more reliable, hopefully linux based, windows resources extractor for archive/windowsResource


/-----------------\
| Medium Priority |
\-----------------/
* Add image/telepaint support using the DOS S`HOWSS.EXE /T 5 <file>`  which will show the image for 5 seconds, during which time I can take a screenshot

* image/amosPicturePacker currently is only supported by abydos and it doesn't always get it right. It also doesn't associated .pal palette files: https://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/2209/Assassins%203%20-%20The%20Ultimate%20Games%20CD%20(1997)(Weird%20Science)[!][Amiga-CD32-CDTV].iso/play_zone/animal_pairs/pictures
  Perhaps get deark to add support for this format.

* Improve 'fragile' formats (these are very sensitive and sometimes convert OK, sometimes don't. May be CPU load related, may be something else):
  archive/windowsResource				Converter program is sensitive, would like to find a better resource ripper, maybe even code my own
  archive/hypercard						Sometimes certain cards/bitmaps don't render
  font/amigaBitmapFont					Program Fony appears to be sensitive
  document/pageMaker					The program (especially pagemaker7) may be sensitive as often it will end up converting with older converters
  document/hlp & multimediaViewerBook	Sometimes things don't convert under CPU load, several files just don't show up

* When DiscMaster was around, encountered several BitRock installers with this search: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=BitRock+Installer&qfields=content&formatid=xml
  These may be able to be extracted using: https://gist.github.com/mickael9/0b902da7c13207d1b86e

* Would be nice to take this Java program and make a CLI conversion program from it's code (git cloned a copy into sandbox/app/): https://github.com/kreativekorp/powerpaint
  I submitted an issue on their GitHub asking if that would be possible, or at least some help in which classes/methods to use to make it happen
  Go through formats it supports (see programs_formats.txt) and try them out against dexvert test cases and consider adding to dexvert

* Get someone to convert this really old UNIX code to compiled under modern linux (git cloned a copy into sandbox/app/): https://github.com/hkaiser/TRiAS/tree/master/Kartenverarbeitung/Imtools
  Go through formats it supports (see programs_formats.txt) and try them out against dexvert test cases and consider adding to dexvert

* Add support music/fuxoftAYLanguage and music/ayAMAD
  Ay_Emul can play both these, but it doesn't have CLI conversion supportso I could do either:
  1. Add CLI conversion support to Ay_Emul (see email about building it from svbulba@gmail.com)
  2. Patch ZXtune (which uses Ay_Emul) to support these formats
     If I do ZXTune, submit patch here: https://bitbucket.org/zxtune/zxtune/issues/150/ay-amad-support
     In EITHER CASE, make sure I'm using the latest versions of both the above before trying

* Take this 'xv' program that runs in Linux and make a CLI tool that leverages it's support of formats to convert to PNG
  https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/xv
  Specifically I want to convert image/yanagisawaPIC2 into PNG with: https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/xv/-/blob/master/xvpic2.c

* Get the IFF-RGFX datatype installed and working in vamos: http://aminet.net/package/util/dtype/RGFX-DT or http://aminet.net/package/util/dtype/RGFX-DT35
  Once it can view pictures, see about how I can convert into PNG, maybe with: https://aminet.net/package/gfx/conv/gfxcon
  Also see if I can add IFF YAFA support
  If either of the above fails, then add below to Low Priorty: Code my own image converter for IFF RGFX and IFF YAFA that leverages ancient to do unpacking of the data. See deark issues for more details.

* Add POVRAY rendering support, see the notes in povRay.js
  Example files: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/15720/Disk18.iso/ZIPS/POV@.EXE/POV
  Other POV files: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=pov&qfields=ext&family=text&dedup=dedup

* InstallShield cab extraction can be problematic as unshield doesn't work correctly with everything.
  For example CABS from: https://archive.org/details/250TCF
  They take up 653MB of space but only 62MB is extracted.
  Possible options: https://community.flexera.com/t5/InstallShield-Knowledge-Base/Installshield-Setup-exe-Command-Line-Parameters/ta-p/4270
  Or maybe try installing Install Shield authoring itself to see if I can open them or build an extractor or something:
	https://archive.org/details/install-shield-6.2-pro-std.-7z
	https://archive.org/details/installshield1150premier

* Get AARU support working: https://github.com/aaru-dps/Aaru
  https://archive.org/details/cd32-gamer-volume-11-1xcd		/Disc Dump/CD32_11.aaruf
  https://archive.org/details/cd32gamervolume91xcd			/Disc Dump/CD32Gamer9.dicf
  Then add that converter as an option to all formats that it supports

* Now that Print to File/PDF works better, should now be able to support:
  document/greenstreetPublisher (Open in win2k (or winxp) with Publishing Suite 99)

* Now that I emulate a real sound card with 86Box, I may be able to support music/famiTracker in winxp. See note

* ISOs I was unable to process:
	No idea what format this is in: https://archive.org/details/Royal_Tyrrell_Museum_Virtual_Tour_2003_WIN98
	These don't convert for some reason, they both appear to be Mac CDs
		https://archive.org/details/800_jeux_pour_mac		This one has an extra 16 bytes at front, removing it doesn't fix it, but did allow UniExtract to extract a TOAST partition, but couldn't process that at all either
		https://archive.org/details/Lex-C-RomSharewareExpress	no idea on this one
	Raw mac partition dumps:
		https://archive.org/details/apple-r-p-lib-internal-v-1.0
		https://archive.org/details/apple-r-p-lib-internal-v-2.0
		https://archive.org/details/apple-r-p-lib-reseller-v-1.0_202007

* See if I can detect and extract the compressed files in sandbox/fail/unsupportedCompression/*
  Maybe something from: https://www.sac.sk/files.php?d=7&l=

* It's possible that video/riffMultimediaMovie is actually a Director 3 Mac file already supported by ScummVM: https://discord.com/channels/350407629849493504/1033065501984817252/1038536366818086963
  This would entail creating a SCUMMVM based CLI tool to process these. See the comments in format/macromediaDirector.js

* Now that wine works and thus .NET and other vista/win7 programs work, try incorporating these programs into dexvert:
	reaConverter 7		https://www.reaconverter.com/		(see sandbox/app/reaConverter_formats.txt for format list. image/zbr can be converted to SVG with reaConverter)
	music/masterTracksPro: Using sandbox/app/master_tracks_pro_full.exe and S/N in email, could convert these to MIDI
	image/xRes: Using sandbox/app/xRes 3.0.iso
	*.DAX: Forgotten Realms Gold Box. "Gold Box Explorer" (sandbox/app/gbexplorer-1.2.zip) code from here: https://github.com/simeonpilgrim/goldboxexplorer	http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=dax&qfields=ext&family=unknown&sortBy=itemid
	Japanese Visual Novels: A variety of archive formats, many supported by this program: https://github.com/morkt/GARbro    Then reprocess: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/1123
	Stuffit Expander for Stuffit-X files might work in 64bit Vista? http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=sitx&qfields=ext&formatid=unknown
	SGS.DAT: Main DAT file from the Hyper Animation games. See sandbox/apps/DecomposeSGS		http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=sgs.dat&family=unknown

* Add OS/2 support by either using OS/2 Warp 4.5.2 (winworld) on 86Box or by using ArcaOS (was blue lion) in vbox/vmware: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utse8P_L8k0
  Then add format support for:
	archive/os2FTCOMP
	archive/os2InstallPackage
	archive/iconHeaven
	image/pmDraw
	document/os2Help	(https://hobbes.nmsu.edu/?path=%2Fpub%2Fos2%2Futil%2Fconvert)

* Add OS X support, running under tomsething like vbox/vmware.
  Then add programs:
	Graphic Converter (https://www.lemkesoft.de/en/products/graphicconverter/key-features/import-and-export-formats
	First test on my real mac to see if I can convert files via CLI (check PCX, AOL Art, etc) (see Help->CLI Commands)
	If CLI works then try getting it working in a virtual machine of some sort, something more portable than QEMU
	To run the supervisor.sh script on boot: https://www.karltarvas.com/2020/09/11/macos-run-script-on-startup.html
  Add format support:
	archive/sparseImage

* Add Classic MacOS support so the following can be supported:
	These seem to be Disk Copy 5/6, which I may be able to extract/convert with: http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/disk-copy-6
	  https://archive.org/details/GigaROM2.0.img
	  https://archive.org/details/InfoMac5Disk1.img
	  https://archive.org/details/InfoMac5Disk2.img

* Add RISC OS support, with one of these emulators:
	https://www.marutan.net/rpcemu/index.php
	http://arcem.sourceforge.net/
	http://b-em.bbcmicro.com/arculator/
	http://www.virtualacorn.co.uk/product.htm  (only runs on Windows)
	http://www.riscos.com/shop/products/106/index.htm  
  Will want to find CineWorks application and probably stick to version 3.x of RiscOS: https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/5/topics/248?page=2
  Then add support for:
	unsupported/audio/audioWorksSoundSample
	video/acornReplayVideo
  More samples from:
	https://archive.org/details/cine-clips
	https://archive.org/details/acorn_replay_collection
	https://archive.org/details/cdrom-riscos-clipart
	https://archive.org/details/cdrom-riscos-risc-disc-1

* Add DOS printing support to DOSBox with a patch from: https://sourceforge.net/p/dosbox/patches/?limit=250
  Once I have that I could support certain formats like:
	document/dartHypertext
	document/envisionPublisherDoc
	document/ibmStoryboardDocument

* Add Old 32bit Linux support then add (see notes for each format):
  music/beRoTracker
  music/synderSNG

* Create dexvert.com with a 'Browse' button that allows you to upload files to convert.
  Bonus points if I make a quick dirty 'dexvert.sh' bash script that folks can use that will convert via wget from CLI via dexvert.com
  WARNING! I need to assume that it will be exploited since I run so many programs, many of which likely have exploits.
  So I will want to research how to run programs within some sort of jailbreak, or leverage the docker image with multiple instances

* Add rendering of previews of full game maps supported by 'gamemap': https://github.com/Malvineous/libgamemaps
  Research them here: https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net

* Add 3D/Poly support. Can convert everything to GLTF/GLB format and use this viewer on the website: https://modelviewer.dev/
  Or use X3D instead?  https://cadexchanger.com/blog/3d-formats-overview-vrml-and-x3d/
  3DS is 3DS Max, so use that to convert things like: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/1268/Graphics%20Plus.iso/media/objects/3ds/ve_space/romulan.zip
  Software to convert DXF (and others) to GLB: https://github.com/assimp/assimp
  Other software that works with GLB: https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Project-Explorer/
  https://castle-engine.io/view3dscene.php
  Converting Shockwave 3D files: https://github.com/tomysshadow/Shockwave-3D-World-Converter
  https://cadexchanger.com/contact-us/licensing-inquiry/#requestFormSection
- Over 8,000 lightWave3DScenes that have not been properly identified yet : http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=LWSC&qfields=content&family=text&formatid=txt
- For THUMBNAILS of polys, just a PNG screenshot, but with a line/globe/3d model looking icon in the bottom right corner of the thumbnail
- Ray Dream Studio 5.5 works ok on Windows XP and loaded some sample RDS files I tried: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/16286/Ray%20Dream%20Studio%205.5%20(MetaCreations)(1999).iso/pc
  It has multiple export options. Make sure files get the .rds extension, without it they wouldn't open (http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/16284/Ray%20Dream%20Studio%20(CDRAYD1)%20(Ray%20Dream)%20(1995).iso/Dream%20Models/Lifeform/PENGUIN)
- Add support for VRML. Possible renderers: https://github.com/castle-engine/view3dscene, Blender, Blaxxun Contact 4.4
  Would love have it be interactive in the browser. See the 3D/Poly support note below:
- Would be great if on the 'browse' page each model could be viewed inline in a small thumbnail sized interactive viewer. Though this may be too intensive? Maybe generate thumbs for each one, as we do for images and show the thumbs instead
  For a Before/After screenshot, can use search results: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=3dmf&itemid=9374
- Then use this doom2vrml program to make doom levels browseable: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/6095/WIN95_09962.iso/vrml/dm2v-10.zip  or  http://www.ocnus.com/doom.html
  Then reply to tweet: https://twitter.com/senn_twt/status/1591342713739288576?s=12&t=Y840vTjzTkojj8W_7FWPNw
- Would be amazing if other levels (Hexen, Heretic, Unreal, Wolfenstein 3D, Quake, etc) were flyable too
- Would also be cool if it could convert and render entire levels liek Warcraft maps, warcraft 3 maps, doom, hexen, quake and valve maps, etc
- poly/rayDreamDesignerScene openable in Corel Draw 7?
- Add support for this 3D format: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/2020/The%20640%20Meg%20Shareware%20Studio%20CD-ROM%20Volume%20II%20(Data%20Exo)(1993).ISO/graphics/3d25.zip

* Pay someone to add more formats to FFMPEG (gl/dl/ANIM/etc) or to improve existing formats: http://www.ffmpeg.org/consulting.html

/----------------\
| Probably Never |
\----------------/
* Consider switching away from DOSBOX and use an authentic MS-DOS installation under 86Box
   Pro: Compatability with some dexvert/dos/* programs that didn't work under dosbox (of which I don't know of any). Feels cleaner.
  Cons: Would need to solve video recording & keyboard control (both of which I wrote custom code patches to DOSBOX to implement)
  I could maybe add similar code to 86Box, but that would be harder to control from 'within' dos.
  It's probably not worth doing since I can't think of many 'benefits' and what I have with DOSBox "works ok"

* Add 3DO support. Ideally via mount using dexvert/sandbox/app/operafs but I'd need to update that code to compile against modern linux kernel
  Other 3DO extractor programs: https://forum.uqm.stack.nl/index.php?topic=3535.0
  Some additional OperaFS programs: http://altmer.arts-union.ru/3DO/3do_utils.htm

* Try and get support added to linux kernel for mounting CDI images. Seems like a tall order.
  Could ask on IRC OFTC #kernelnewbies and ##linux on freenode about where I could find someone who could do this, and maybe pay them to do it
  https://www.isobuster.com/help/cd-i_and_vcd
  https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Green+Book+CD-ROM
  https://www.lscdweb.com/data/downloadables/2/8/cdi_may94_r2.pdf
  See some tools in sandbox/app/CD-i Image Decoding Tools rhdn.zip
  Additional tools for CD-I from here (including animation stuff): https://archive.org/details/various.cd-i.utilities.3.5hd.os9

* Create native C nodejs module for imagemagick/recoil and other libs (abydos, etc) for speed. Example existing image magick one: https://github.com/elad/node-imagemagick-native

* Convert bitmap fonts to more usable vector fonts by trying to "autotrace" the fonts, or utilize a pro tool like: https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/bitfonter/   or   https://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/transtype/
