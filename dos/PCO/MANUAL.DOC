                      Disk Based Documentation

     This document contains the "Getting Started" sections from
         the actual PC-Outline manual.  It is designed, in
     combination with the PC-Outline user interface, to get you
     up and running and doing useful things with PC-Outline in
        a very short time.  It does not, however, contain a
      detailed description of all the PC-Outline commands nor
          pretend to be a comprehensive tutorial or user's
        reference.  Registered users can receive the actual
          PC-Outline manual which does contain a complete
      description of all commands.  Details on registering are
           in the last section titled registration form.

     rights reserved world wide. Both the PC-Outline program and
     documentation is copyrighted. It can not be disassembled or
     modified without our express written consent.

     PC-Outline is distributed on a ShareWare basis. You may use
     PC-Outline without charge for the purposes of evaluating it's
     suitability for your use. We suggest that this evaluation period be
     limited to 30 days of actual use. If you find that PC-Outline is
     worth continuing to use, then you are required to pay for it. We
     call the payment a "Registration Fee". Simply complete the
     registration form and mail it in to use with your payment. If your
     company requires an invoice, we suggest that you use a copy of this
     registration as the pro forma invoice. When you register your copy
     of PC-Outline, you'll receive the latest version of the program,
     along with a comprehensive printed user manual and free unlimited
     technical support for one year. We aggressively develop our
     products, and as a registered user you'll be entitled to upgrades to
     the newest versions as they are released, at a greatly reduced
     price. Most importantly though, by registering your copy of
     PC-Outline (or any ShareWare product), you'll ensure the survival of
     the convenient and risk free distribution method that brought you
     PC-Outline in the first place.

     If you have received this copy from a Users' Group, "Software
     Library" or "SIG", and have paid a small fee (usually $3 to $10),
     you have NOT acquired the registered rights or continued right to
     use PC-Outline. This fee was for the convenience of obtaining the
     diskette with PC-Outline on it. The fee does NOT apply to the
     registration fee. If you have obtained a "ShareWare" copy of
     PC-Outline from Brown Bag Software, and have paid a small fee, this
     fee IS applicable towards registration if you register your copy
     within 90 days.

     If you don't know whether or not your copy of PC-Outline is
     registered or not, then look for an original diskette with a printed
     Brown Bag Software diskette label. If in doubt, just call us or
     write us. As of October 1987, Brown Bag Software has offices in
     London, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Cologne and Zurich. Our products are
     available locally in these cities with local technical support,
     payable in local currency and shipped from within the EEC without
     duty. If this version of PC-Outline does NOT support the European
     keyboard, then you will receive a version that DOES support the
     keyboard WHEN YOU REGISTER.

     You may freely copy PC-Outline for distribution under the ShareWare
     concept, without charge.

     You may NOT charge any fee for the PC-Outline program or
     documentation without our WRITTEN APPROVAL (usually granted).

     You may NOT distribute PC-Outline or it's documentation in
     connection with ANY commercial venture, product, publication or
     service without our written approval.

                  WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH PC-Outline
                  -------------------------------

     PC-Outline is an outlining and planning program.  It
     allows you to randomly enter information of almost any
     type (thoughts, plans, ideas, etc.) and then organize it
     into a hierarchial structure.  Once in the hierarchial
     structure, you can view the information in many powerful
     ways.  For example, using the hide/unhide feature, you
     can view just down to any level of detail in the outline
     that you want.  With a single keystroke, you can go from
     viewing the lowest level of detail to a view that shows
     you only the highest, most important topics.

     With another few keystrokes, you can print the outline,
     send it to a file compatible with your word processor,
     copy it into another outline, or paste it directly into
     your word processor.

     PC-Outline is particularly appropriate for list making.
     Tasks like making todo lists or planning a project are
     ideally suited for PC-Outline.

     For an example of how the hierarchical structure works
     and how you can hide and unhide parts of the outline,
     start PC-Outline and load the outline titled HIDING. The
     text in the outline will help show you what PC-Outline
     can do.

                         PC-Outline FACTS
                         ----------------

     For those of your who like statistics or lists, here are
     a few about PC-Outline.

          Standard PC-Outline outlining features include:

             - hierarchical outline structure
             - structured indenting
             - hide/unhide (collapse/expand) any portion of the outline
             - powerful outline rearrangement functions

          Advanced PC-Outline features include:

             - automatic numbering, including choice of numbering style
               (alphabetic, numeric, roman, bullets, or none)
             - easy, pull-down menus
             - multi-line outline entries
             - automatic paragraph reformatting
             - margin control
             - centering, left and right justification
             - hanging indents
             - search and replace
             - on screen page break display
             - conditional and hard page breaks
             - block copies, moves, and deletes
             - tab stop settings
             - send printer control strings
             - printer formatting: underline, boldface, italics,
               sub/superscript, double strike
             - windowing: up to 9 outlines open/on screen at once in
               user-defined windows
             - zoom any window to full screen with a single keystroke
             - copy or move outline or text directly between windows
             - customizable printer drivers
             - sorting
             - user defined macros/key redifinition
             - live date and time stamps
             - full support for dos 2.0 and above
             - read/write other file formats including: ascii, Wordstar,
               ThinkTank/Ready!
             - data transfer with other programs including cut and paste
               to other active programs while memory resident
             - configuration file to set startup defaults
             - compatible with other memory resident programs (like
               SideKick, ProKey, etc.)
             - freely mix outlines and text: titles, skip numbering, start
               new numbering, move placement right and left
             - return to dos without leaving PC-Outline

          PC-Outline requires dos 2.0 or greater, one floppy disk drive,
     128k RAM, and an IBM PC/XT/AT or compatible, and can be configured to
     occupy as little as 80k when memory resident.

                                   6

                          GETTING STARTED
                          ---------------

                          MAKING A BACKUP
                          ---------------

     Before using PC-Outline, make a backup copy of the program
     and all of its documentation files.  Put this backup away
     in a safe place for emergency use only if something were
     to happen to your original.

                          FOR FLOPPY USE
                          --------------
     
     Insert the PC-Outline disk into the default drive and type
     PCO to the dos prompt.


                         FOR HARD DISK USE
                         -----------------

     Create a directory where you would like to keep all of
     your outline files.  Copy the file PCO.EXE from the floppy
     program disk to this directory.  Set the current logged
     directory to your outline directory and type PCO to the
     dos prompt.

     To be able to use PC-Outline from any directory on your
     hard disk see the appendix on USING PC-Outline ON A HARD
     DISK.

               FOR USE AS A MEMORY RESIDENT PROGRAM
               ------------------------------------

     To use PC-Outline as a memory resident program (where it
     is always instantly available at the touch of a key),
     start the program with PCO/r instead of just PCO.  This
     tells PC-Outline that you want to load the memory resident
     version instead.  You will get a brief copyright message
     and PC-Outline will be permanently resident in memory.  To
     start PC-Outline just press ^\ (control backslash).  The
     invoke key can be changed to anything you like using the
     separate program KEYSET.COM.

     You may want to place the command PCO/r in your
     autoexec.bat file so that PC-Outline is automatically
     loaded each time you boot your computer.  See the
     following section on other command parameter startup
     options to adjust the amount of memory that PC-Outline
     will use.  The default is about 128k but can be adjusted
     as low as 90k.



                                   7

     If you are using PC-Outline in the memory resident mode,
     you should regularly save your work.  If one of the other
     programs that you are running should hang or cause your
     computer to crash, you will lose any un-saved outlines.
     It is a good practice to save your outlines before
     returning to your main application (the single keystroke
     ^S will accomplish this).

     PC-Outline is designed to be compatible with as many other
     memory-resident programs as possible.  Because all memory
     resident programs have their own way of being memory
     resident, some conflicts are bound to exist.  When you
     have problems, experiment with the order the programs are
     loaded.   Although we cannot tell you how PC-Outline will
     interact with all other memory-resident programs, we do
     know that PC-Outline itself will be the most reliable when
     it is loaded last.  If another program also says that it
     wants to be loaded last, then you may need to experiment
     with the correct loading order for the two programs to
     work with one another.  In general, you should load
     PC-Outline after keyboard enhancers like Prokey.  If you
     load PC-Outline after SideKick, both programs will
     function fine except that you will not be able to invoke
     PC-Outline from within SideKick.


                        THE FIRST SCREEN
                         ----------------

     Once the program starts, the first screen is a message
     explaining the shareware distribution concept, how it
     works, how you can most benefit from it, and how you can
     help support it.  To continue past this screen, press any
     key.

     In the future, you may start the program by typing PCO /q
     to the dos prompt instead of just PCO and you will bypass
     the opening screen.  It may be helpful to create a batch
     file that types the PCO /q for you each time.  We do ask,
     however, that if you copy the program for someone, please
     do not supply them with the batch file that bypasses the
     shareware screen.  It is to both our and your advantage to
     help as many users as possible both learn about and
     support the shareware concept.

                         THE OPENING MENU
                         ----------------

     The opening menu offers you four choices.  To choose one
     of the four options, either use the up and down arrow keys
     to select the option you want and press RET or just press
     the first letter of the desired option (i.e. press "o" to
     choose Open a New Outline).  Pressing the ESC key will
     always abort the current operation.


                                   8

                         OPEN A NEW OUTLINE
                         ------------------

     Enter any legal dos path or path and filename except do
     not use an extension on the eight character name.
     PC-Outline will automatically add the extension .PCO.  If
     you do not type a filename, then the file will be created
     in the directory listed on the bottom line of the screen
     (known as the current directory).  If you type the name of
     an outline that already exists, then it will be loaded
     rather than creating a new one with the same name.

                      LOAD AN EXISTING OUTLINE
                      ------------------------

     Choose one of the existing outlines to load by pointing to
     it with the arrows and pressing RET.  If no outlines exist
     in the current directory, then PC-Outline will assume that
     you must want to create a new outline and will prompt you
     accordingly.  If you realize that you are logged into the
     wrong directory or you change your mind for some other
     reason, you can always press ESC to back up a step.

                      CHANGE DRIVE/DIRECTORY
                      ----------------------

     Enter the new current directory.  This command obeys most
     of the same rules as dos.  If you enter a full path name,
     then that becomes your new current directory.  If you
     enter just a sub-directory name, then that is appended
     onto the existing directory path.  To just change logged
     drives, just type "d:" where d is the desired drive.

                               QUIT
                               ----

     Choose this option to exit PC-Outline and return to dos.


              OTHER COMMAND PARAMETER STARTUP OPTIONS
              ---------------------------------------

     A command parameter option is a sequence of special
     characters typed after the program name when starting a
     program from dos.  In the sections above we already
     introduced the command parameters "/r" and "/q".  There
     are a number of other command parameters:

     /b - forces the display to black and white
     /s - makes screen activity faster on most non-IBM screens
     /m = xxx specifies how much memory to reserve for outline
          data in the memory resident version.  For example
          /m=22 would reserve 22k for outline data.  Since the
          program itself will occupy about 60k, this would be a

                                   9

          grand total of 82k.  The default is /m=64.
     /d - causes PC-Outline to ignore the starting directory
          that you may have entered in the ADVANCED
          CONFIGURATION menu and instead use the current
          directory when PC-Outline was started.  This is
          useful if you keep most of your outlines in one
          directory (so you set the starting directory), but
          sometimes you want to start out with the current
          directory.

                        THE WORKING SCREEN
                        ------------------

     There are a number of parts to the normal working screen.

     The bottom line usually contains a message indicating some
     of your current options.  The end of the bottom row tells
     you how much free memory you have.

     The 2nd line from the bottom show the current ruler with
     left and right margins, tab stops and the current cursor
     position.
     
     The next to last column is a status column that tells you
     information about the current line.
     
     A blank means this line ends in wordwrap.
     A period means this line is past the end of the outline.
     A dash means this line is the last line in an outline
     entry and there are no sub-entries.
     A down arrow means this line is the last line in an
     outline entry and there are sub-entries.
     A chevron means that this line ends in a hard carriage
     return.
     Reverse video means that this outline entry has either its
     children or its text hidden.
     
     The second column is a page break indication column.  The
     last line of each page will show a square block.
     
     The second row is a status line that lists the following:
     
       -  The current path/filename (only the last 20
               characters are show here).  The full filename
               can always be seen with the WINDOW LIST command.
       -  The amount of memory the outline occupies so far in
               K-bytes.
       -  The status of Insert/Overwrite for editing.
       -  Page, line, and column information.
       -  The current system time.
       -  The window number.
     
     The top line shows the top level menu options.
     
     
                       HOW TO USE THE MENUS
                       --------------------

     The menu system is designed to be both easy to learn for
     the novice and quick to use for the experienced user.
     Because of this, there are several ways to invoke and use
     the menus - each method varies in speed and ease of use.



                                   11

     THE EASY WAY

     The easiest way to use the menus is to press the INS key.
     This will start up the FILE menu.  To choose one of the
     other menus, use the right and left arrow keys to position
     the menu along the menu bar.  Within any one of the menus
     you may make a selection by either pointing to the desired
     option and pressing RET or by pressing the first letter of
     the desired option.  Pressing the ESC key will always exit
     the current menu.
     
     THE QUICK WAY #1

     To start directly in one of the menus, press the "/" key
     (forward slash) and then the first letter of the desired
     menu.  Thus, to go immediately to the DISPLAY menu you
     would type /d or immediately to the OUTLINE menu would be
     /o.  In order to actually use the / key in your text, just
     type it twice.  Note that this key can be changed to
     whatever you like using the setup program called
     KEYSET.COM.
     
     THE QUICK WAY #2

     An alternate way to start directly in one of the menus is
     to press Alt and the first letter of the desired menu.
     For example Alt-d would start the DISPLAY menu and Alt-o
     would start the OUTLINE menu.
     
     SHORTCUT KEYSTROKES
     
     In addition to choosing items through menus, many of the
     more common functions have single key shortcuts.  If a
     menu item can also be accomplished with a shortcut
     keystroke, then that keystroke will be listed in
     parentheses in the menu.  For example, in the OUTLINE
     menu, the option CREATE NEW OUTLINE ENTRY can also be done
     by just typing a control-N.  In addition to the
     pre-defined shortcut keystrokes, you can create your own
     by using keyboard macros.  See the section on macros in
     the description of the ADVANCED menu for more information.
     
                      HOW TO USE OPTION BOXES
                      -----------------------
     
     Some menu selections will lead you to an option box where
     you will be presented with a number of different options
     to choose from.  For example, selecting PARAGRAPH STYLE
     from the display menu, brings up an option box with the
     choices left margin, right margin, paragraph alignment,
     and first line alignment.  To change one of the options,
     use the up and down arrow keys to position the cursor in



                                   12

     the desired option.  The bottom line of the screen should
     indicate what to do next depending upon what type of
     option it is.

     When you have correctly specified one of the options, you
     can press RET to enter that new option and leave the
     option box or you can use the up and down arrow keys to
     set another option.  If you use the up or down arrow keys
     to move to another option, the option you just changed
     will be updated and set and a mark will indicate you have
     changed that item.  The item is already changed; pressing
     ESC will still leave that item changed.
     
     If you are in the middle of changing an option and you
     decide you don't want to change it after all, you can
     press the ESC key.  If that item has not yet been marked
     as changed, that particular option will remain unchanged
     and you will exit the option box.
     
     The startup values for most of the parameters in the
     option boxes are contained in a special configuration file
     called PCO.CFG.  Each time PC-Outline is started it reads
     this file and loads the startup values from it.  To set
     new default parameters, press the F10 key while in an
     option box and those parameters will be saved to the
     configuration file as they are listed in the option box.
     
     Note that, when saving new values to the configuration
     file, PC-Outline will look for the PCO.CFG file in the
     current directory from when you started PC-Outline.  If it
     is not there, then it will create one.  If the current
     directory is not where you want the configuration file to
     normally be then you can enter a file/path name in the
     CONFIGURATION option box in the ADVANCED menu to direct
     where it will go.
     
     There are basically three types of options:
     
     NUMBERS
     
     An option like a left margin requires a number.  To change
     the left margin, simply enter a new number.
     
     CHOICES
     
     Some options offer you a series of choices.  To change the
     option, you must pick a new choice.  For example,
     paragraph alignment can be one of four choices:  left
     aligned, right aligned, justified, centered.  To toggle
     through the different choices, press the space bar.  The
     left and right arrows also work for toggling.  The right
     arrow works just like the space bar and the left arrow
     goes the reverse order through the choices.
     

                                   13

     If you already know which choice you want, you can just
     press the first letter of the desired choice.  For
     example, pressing the letter "j" would select justified in
     the above example.  Note that this can be useful when
     defining a macro because you can select a specific option
     without knowing what it was previously set to.

     STRINGS

     Some options require you to input some series of
     characters.  One such example would be a filename.  In
     this case, you are free to edit the name as you type.  The
     following keys are active:  Home, End, INS, DEL,
     Backspace, Left Arrow, and Right Arrow.

                    CREATING YOUR FIRST OUTLINE
                    ---------------------------

        ENTERING INFORMATION INTO THE FIRST OUTLINE ELEMENT
        ---------------------------------------------------

     Once you have loaded PC-Outline, passed the shareware
     screen, and started an outline file from the opening menu,
     you are ready to create an outline.  The screen will show
     an "A." and then the cursor.  The "A." indicates you are
     in the first outline element.  To enter information into
     this first outline element, just type.  The information in
     an outline element can be anything from a single word to a
     multi-page document.  If you type enough words to get to
     the right margin, the cursor will automatically wrap
     around and start the next line.

                CREATING THE SECOND OUTLINE ELEMENT
                -----------------------------------

     When you are ready to start a second outline element,
     press the INS key.  This starts the FILE menu.  Press the
     right arrow key to enter the OUTLINE menu.  Now choose
     CREATE NEW OUTLINE ENTRY (note that you can also do this
     with the shortcut keystroke ^N or ^RET).

     This will present you with a reverse video "B." positioned
     one line after the last piece of text in "A.".  Notice
     that the bottom line of the screen now contains the
     message: "ENTER TEXT OR PRESS ARROWS TO MOVE THIS NEW
     ENTRY."

              POSITIONING THE SECOND OUTLINE ELEMENT
              --------------------------------------

     Before typing any other characters, you can make this new
     entry a sub-entry of "A." by pressing the right arrow.  If
     it was already a sub-entry, you could promote it up a
     level by pressing the left arrow.  You could also switch
     places with "A." by pressing the up arrow.  The down arrow
     will switch back again.  As soon as you type any
     characters, the "B." will change back to normal video and
     you can no longer move the entry in this manner and the
     message at the bottom of the screen will change back to
     the message about menus.  There are other commands for
     moving the entry once you have typed characters.

     By repeating this process of typing text and choosing
     CREATE NEW OUTLINE ENTRY, you can create as simple or
     complex an outline structure as you want.





                                   15

                      HIDING OUTLINE ELEMENTS
                      -----------------------

     A major advantage of organizing information in an outline
     structure is that you can hide levels of detail.  Supposed
     we had the example outline listed below.  If we position
     the cursor in element B. and select CURRENT ENTRY'S
     CHILDREN from the HIDE menu, the sub-entries (from now on
     referred to as children) of B. will disappear.  Select
     CURRENT ENTRY'S CHILDREN from the SHOW menu and they will
     reappear.  The GRAY PLUS key on the right side of the
     keyboard can be used as a shortcut to toggle the
     hide/unhide status of children.
     
     Before hiding the children of B.
     
     A. ---
     B. ---              Cursor position in this entry.
        1. ---
        2. ---
        3. ---
     C. ---
     
     After hiding the children of B.
     
     A. ---
     B. ---
     C. ---
     
     After showing the children of B. again:
     
     A. ---
     B. ---
        1. ---
        2. ---
        3. ---
     C. ---
     
                            HIDING TEXT
                            -----------
     
     Within any given outline element, you have three viewing
     choices.  You may either see the entire entry (the default
     case), you may see either just the first line of the entry
     (we say the text is hidden), or the entire entry might be
     hidden as in the above section.  To see just the first
     line of a multi-line entry, choose CURRENT ENTRY'S TEXT
     from the HIDE menu.  To see the rest of the lines again,
     choose CURRENT ENTRY'S TEXT from the SHOW menu.  The ^PgDn
     key works as a shortcut toggle to alternately hide and
     show the multiple lines.  Note also that typing any
     character (including a right arrow) in an entry
     automatically shows the multiple lines.

                            HELP SCREEN
                            -----------

     While in the main editing mode (not in any menus),
     pressing the F1 key will bring up a help screen that will
     list many of the keystrokes for outline editing.

                          ABOUT PRINTERS
                          --------------

     PC-Outline uses a printer driver in order to have the
     capability of supporting a number of different printers.
     Each printer driver is a special file format containing
     the printer codes for the desired printer for the print
     features that PC-Outline uses.  The disk that PC-Outline
     comes on has as many printer drivers as we currently have
     available.   To find out if your printer is supported, run
     the program on the disk called PCPRINT.COM by typing
     PCPRINT to the dos prompt.  If your printer is not
     specified in the list, then you have two choices:
     
     1)   You may choose to not use any special print features.
          Normal printing will most likely work even if your
          printer is not specifically supported.
     
     2)   You may create your own printer driver by entering
          the codes yourself in the PRINT CONFIGURATION menu in
          PC-Outline and saving them to a new printer driver
          file.  Note you should change the printer driver name
          also to avoid conflicts with the already existing
          drivers.


                  USING PC-Outline ON A HARD DISK
                  -------------------------------

     It is possible to set up PC-Outline so that you can start
     it from anywhere on your hard disk by just typing a simple
     three letter name.  You will never again need to worry
     about which directory you are in when you want to run
     PC-Outline.  Dos will automatically find the program, run
     it, and PC-Outline will set the starting directory as
     desired.  To accomplish this, follow these steps:

     1)   Set up a directory on your hard disk where you wish
          to keep your PC-Outline files.  For purposes of
          explanation, I will refer to a directory called
          C:\OUTLINE (you can use any name you want).

     2)   Copy the files PCO.EXE, PCO.CFG, PCO.ECT and the
          appropriate printer driver to the C:\OUTLINE directory.

     3)   Add the following command to your autoexec.bat file:
          SET PCO=C:\OUTLINE\PCO.CFG.

     4)   Set a path to the outline directory (preferably in
          your autoexec.bat file so it is always set).  For
          example, use the command "PATH C:\OUTLINE".

     5)   Now, from anywhere on your hard disk, you can type
          PCO.  The DOS path will find the batch file PCO.EXE

                                   20

          and run it.  PC-Outline will look in the dos
          environment (where the SET PCO= command is stored)
          and find out where to look for the configuration
          file & Shareware screen file (PCO.ECT).  The confi-
          guration file will tell PC-Outline
          what directory to start off with for outline files
          (set in the CONFIGURATION option box in the ADVANCED
          menu.  It sounds complicated, but once you have set
          it up, all you have to type is "PCO" and your path,
          the SET command, and the configuration file will do
          all the rest.

              SITE LICENSES AND BUNDLING ARRANGEMENTS
              ---------------------------------------

     Corporate site licenses and bundling arrangements are
     available direct from Brown Bag Software.

     Site licenses can be used to distribute large quantities of
     PC-Outline and its documentation within a specific
     organization at very reasonable prices (hundreds of dollars
     less per copy than competing products).  All users under a
     site license can become registered users at no extra fee and
     are automatically notified of updates.

     Bundling arrangements can be used to distribute copies of
     PC-Outline in order to promote some other product or
     service.

     Note that neither of these activities is permitted under the
     limited license granted to all users of PC-Outline without
     the expressed written consent of Brown Bag Software.
