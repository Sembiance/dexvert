# Blender LXO Importer
**--> EXPERIMENTAL <--**

This is and importer for [Blender 4.0](https://www.blender.org/) and later to import [Modo's](https://www.foundry.com/products/modo) lxo files.
Credit to [io_scene_lwo](https://github.com/nangtani/blender-import-lwo) which was used as a good starting point.

### Supported Features
* Meshes with UVs, material tags (yay)
* Cameras more or less
* basic ligths (spot, area, sun, point)
* locator transforms, I think
* all other Locator type items as "empties"
* item hierarchy
* option for up and forward axis conversion (hopefully working now...)

### LXO Specification
Incomplete Specification of the LXO file formats can be found [here](https://modosdk.foundry.com/wiki/File_Formats)
