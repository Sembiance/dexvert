     This lists the user visible changes to JAR


     JAR 1.02 release

     Added FAQ section to JAR.DOC.
     Added error message #211.
     Clarified error messages when working with volumes.
     Corrected output in JAR "black and white" mode.
     Fixed memory allocation problem.


     JAR 1.01 BETA_3 TEST release

     Allow archive sharing during non-update operations.
     Clarified the error message sometimes encountered when accessing
        a locked archive.
     Added a few paragraphs to JAR.DOC with more details about chapter
        archives.
     Added "ErrorsToStdout" setting.
     Changed "-js" option default from "-js0" to "-js1"
     Modified the access/creation time handling by JAR32.EXE when the file
        system does not support them. The unsupported date/time is replaced
        with the modification date/time.
     Improved "rh" command and "-jr" option work with truncated archive.
     Fixed rare incorrect Ctrl+C handling.


     JAR 1.01 BETA_2 TEST release

     Renamed DOS JAR executable to JAR16.EXE.  User can rename either JAR
        executable to JAR.EXE according to preference.
     Modified JAR password authentication method.  Please read note (*)
        below.
     Changed testjar.bat to exclude system and hidden files such as
        "sage.dat" in Windows 95.
     Clarified the error messages encountered when using the "-v" option
        with unsupported commands such as "e","x","l".
     Added more detailed JAR archive signature identification information
        to TECHNOTE.DOC.
     Fixed compatibility problem with QEMM.  (Sometimes JAR refused to use
        XMS memory under QEMM).
     Fixed page fault when executing "test" command with archive argument
        missing.

     (*) NOTE: New "Authenticate" method details

       JAR contains an exportable (from USA) archive protection method.
       This method only checks for a valid archive password without using
       actual data encryption.

       In BETA_2, this method has been changed to permit ARJ Software to
       distribute JAR decompressor sources without allowing access to
       protected archive file data.  A modified algorithm independent of
       the password is used to access protected data.  The decompressor
       source will not contain this modified algorithm code.

       This new method is called "Authenticate".  The old "Authentication"
       method is supported during updates and extraction but NOT for
       the creation of new archives.

       The "-hg0" option is the shortcut for "-hgAuthenticate".

       We strongly encourage you to convert archives protected using the
       obsolete "Authentication" method to the new method. The file
       "convprot.bat" is an example batch file which may be used for
       conversion.  We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this
       change.
