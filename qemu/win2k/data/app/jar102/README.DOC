    This archive contains JAR shareware version 1.02.

    The non-evaluation use of JAR in a business, commercial, government or
    institutional environment requires a license.

    This software as originally released by ARJ Software, Inc. came "sealed"
    in an ARJ self-extracting archive with an ARJ-SECURITY envelope to
    prevent tampering.  Re-archival of this software will destroy this
    security feature "seal".


    MAJOR FEATURES OF JAR INCLUDE:

    Native DOS, Windows 95, and Windows NT support.

    The ability to process and archive over 50,000 files at one time.

    JAR provides excellent file compression in terms of resulting archive
    size and speed.  Compared to the popular archivers, PKZIP, RAR, UC2, and
    ARJ, JAR provides typically better compression.

    JAR has the option to create multiple volume archives with one command
    making JAR useful for making backups to multiple floppies or archiving a
    very large file to several floppies without "SLICE"ing. JAR can also
    concatenate multiple volumes into one volume.

    A myriad of commands and options to provide outstanding flexibility in
    archiver usage.
