	This file includes information that supplements the "Microsoft
	Paintbrush User's Guide".


	MICROSOFT PAINTBRUSH:

	Memory requirements:

	MS Paintbrush works best on systems with 640Kb or more memory
	installed.  It is possible for MS Paintbrush to run in systems
	with less memory but performance, drawing size and color capabilities
	are all impacted.

	Remember that all "terminate and stay resident programs" use system
	memory.  If you are experiencing memory limitation problems when
	running MS Paintbrush you may want to remove these TSR programs from
	memory before starting MS Paintbrush.

	Canvas size limitations in VGA 640X480 16-color mode:

	If you've installed MS Paintbrush for the VGA display adapter
	and selected the 640X480 16-color mode then your canvas size
	may be limited to less than a full screen.  You can increase the
	canvas size in one of two ways. 
	
	First, you can reinstall MS Paintbrush by running PBSETUP from the
	disk and directory where MS Paintbrush is installed and select
	the same 640X480 VGA resolution but with 8 or 4 colors.

	Alternatively, you can reinstall MS Paintbrush and select "none"
	for your printer.

	Either of these options will release enough memory to allow MS
	Paintbrush to create a canvas that is at least as large as your
	screen.
	

	Using Extended or Expanded memory to enhance Microsoft Paintbrush
	performance:
	
	If you have extended or expanded memory you can enhance MS
	Paintbrush performance as follows.  Set your extended or expanded 
	memory up as a "ramdisk".  This requires ramdisk device driver 
	software which typically comes with the memory or with DOS.  
	Follow the device driver installation instructions to set up your 
	ramdisk.  You will need a ramdisk of at least 128K bytes.  Next, 
	make the following entry in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
	
	SET TMP=X:
	
	Replace X with the logical unit identifier of your ramdrive. 
	Reboot your system to make these changes take effect.


	PBSETUP:

	Floppy only installations:
	
	If you use PBSETUP to build two Paintbrush diskettes, Run Disk A and
	Run Disk B, and if you have 720K byte, 1.44 M byte or 1.2M byte disk
	drives then, after running PBSETUP, you can create a single run
	diskette.  Simply copy all the files from Run Disk B onto Run Disk A
	and use Run Disk A to run Microsoft Paintbrush.


	Specifying a Printer:
	
	To properly install Microsoft Paintbrush, you need to choose the
	"Select a Printer" option, even if you do not have a printer
	connected to your computer. In this case, simply choose "None"
	from the printer list.

	Okidata 192, 193, 292, and 293 Printers:

	If you are using an Okidata 292, or 293 printer and the printer has a
	color ribbon, you may need to change the printer COLOR setting from
	BLK RBN to BLK.

	You must run a printer setup program to change the default 7 bit
	graphics setting to the 8 bit setting in order to use Microsoft
	Paintbrush with an Okidata 192 or 193 printer with the standard
	Microline ROM or an Okidata 292 or 293 printer with the standard
	Microline personality module.  The title of this setting is APA-7/8
	on some 192 or 193 printers, or B.I. G.-7/8 on other 192 or 193
	printers. Check your Okidata documentation for directions to run
	the printer setup program.

	AT&T Display Enhancement Board:

	Microsoft Paintbrush supports the AT&T Display Enhancement Board 
	(DEB) in the 2-color, 640 x 400 mode only. 

	IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter:

	If you have an IBM Enhanced Graphics Adapter with 64K of
	on-board memory (as opposed to 256K) Microsoft Paintbrush runs
	in the 640 x 200 16-color mode, even if you chose the IBM Enhanced
	Graphics Adapter High-res. 16-color option on the PBSETUP adapter
	list.

	Changing Printers or Display Adapters:

	If, after installing Microsoft Paintbrush, you want to change the
	printer or display adapter you should run PBSETUP from the disk and
	directory where Microsoft Paintbrush is installed.
