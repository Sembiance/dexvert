1. INTRODUCTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

GD View  (GDV)  is an  object-oriented  viewer which lets you look  at the 
contents of files  (and other objects)  while supporting a lot of formats. 
See section 3 for a list of all supported file types.

A lot of file viewers are available  in the computer market but GD View is 
different than  most other ones.  Most other viewers  support just  one or 
possibly a few  file types.  For example  some viewers always  display the 
contents  of a  file as text but  it is  not very  useful  to look  at the 
contents of a picture file as text because they usually do not contain any 
useful text.  Many computer users are  forced to have an entire collection 
of file viewers on their harddisk.  They have to guess which viewer to use 
and how to use it.  This can be relatively complicated,  especially if you 
are dealing with unknown data and you do not know the file type.
GD View  can solve  these problems:  It attempts  to detect  the file type 
automatically  and it  will then  display the file  properly.  This  makes 
everything much easier for you. Not only that GD View can probably display 
more graphic,  document, database,  spreadsheet, animation,  text, binary, 
palette, font, sound, terminal, archive and  encoded file formats than any 
other  DOS  program,  GD View  can  also display  information about  files 
(including  the meaning of  the file name extention),  display information 
about your computer system,  play Audio CDs,  display the contents of your 
base memory,  decode UUE, XXE and  other encoded  files and extract Device 
Independent (Windows) Bitmaps from binary files.

2. LEGAL ISSUES (IMPORTANT!)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

LICENSE AGREEMENT:
You  MUST  understand  and  accept  the  license  agreement  (LICENSE.DOC) 
**before** you  do anything  with GD View.

[Sorry,  I had to write that license agreement to protect myself.  There's 
nothing special about it but you still MUST read it.]

GD View is user supported software. You may test this unregistered version 
for max. 30 days.  After that you must either  become a registered user or 
remove GD View from your system. Read REGISTER.TXT for more information.


All trademarked names  used herein are used  only in an editorial  fashion 
with no intention of infringement of the trademark.  Although they are not 
marked  in any  special way all  trademarked  names are  trademarks of the 
respective trademark owners.

3. CONFIGURATION ISSUES
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The requirements:
 -> an IBM PC compatible computer with a 80286 or better CPU
    (fast '486 or better recommended)
 -> MS DOS 3.0 (or higher) or a 100% compatible operating system
 -> about 600 KB free base memory and about 1MB of free EMS or XMS (more
    EMS or XMS recommended for large directories and some large files)
 -> a VGA or SVGA graphic card (SVGA recommended), a color monitor
 -> for sound files: a Sound Blaster 2.0, Sound Blaster Pro or
    100% compatible sound card
 -> for Audio CDs: a CD-ROM drive (MSCDEX must be loaded)
 -> for CMF files: SBFMDRV.COM must be loaded
 -> optional: a computer mouse or other pointing device (a Microsoft
    compatible mouse driver must be loaded)

About the operating system:
The main target operating system  for GD View is MS DOS but clones such as
Novell DOS should not cause any problems.
It is possible to use GD View with MS Windows,  MS Windows 95,  MS Windows
NT,  OS/2  and some other operating systems  which can run MS DOS programs
but there might be some  unexpected results,  e.g. when  graphic files are
displayed  or sound files are played.  In any case,  make sure that enough
memory is  available  for  GD View  and try to use a  full-screen  mode if
possible!!
Recommendations:
- Windows 3.1: use full-screen mode (you can create a PIF file to
  do that)
- Windows 95: use full-screen mode (can be selected in the properties
  dialog box), long file names are displayed but cannot be used when
  prompted for file names, some functions of the CD Player do not work
- Windows NT: no sound support, some functions of the CD Player
  do not work, long file names can not be used at prompts
- OS/2: use full-screen mode

About graphic cards:
To use the advanced graphic modes of SVGA cards you will need to make your
graphic card accessable via the so called VESA BIOS extention, version 1.2
or higher.  Most  modern  graphic cards  are shipped  with  built-in  VESA
support.  For older cards  you can use  resident programs  which make your
SVGA card VESA compatible.  You should check if there is  one on the disks
which came with your  graphic card.  If not then try to find one online or
contact the manufacturer of your graphic card.
If going into a graphic mode  takes too long  then use the "Auto-configure
VESA graphic modes" selection in GDV SETUP.
Note that using a TrueColor SVGA card is definitely recommended because GD
View does NOT perform any dithering or  any real quantization of graphical
images.

About sound cards:
You will usually have to set some things up before you use GD View to play
sound files.  To do that you have to run setup and select "Configure sound
card".  If you own a sound card which is not listed you will have to check
the manual of it to see to what it is compatible.  Most modern sound cards
are compatible to the  Sound Blaster Pro.  More older ones should at least
be  compatible  to the  Sound Blaster 2.x.  Most Sound Blaster  compatible
sound  cards are  configured  to use  the base port  address 220h  and DMA
channel 1.
Right now,  GD View is not able  to change the  sampling rate  of a  sound
file.  That means that you will  not hear anything if  the sample  rate is
extremely high or extremely low.
SBFMDRV.COM must be loaded if you want to play CMF files.

About memory:
Try to have at least  580 KB of free base memory before  starting GD View.
If you do not have  enough  then your  system can become  unstable or even
crash.  You can free more base memory  by removing resident programs, e.g.
by using MemMaker.  GD View can become  extremely slow if  you do not have
enough free EMS or XMS memory.  The best way to solve most memory problems
with  GD View  is to use  an  advanced  memory manager  like QEMM  or even
better, use the Windows NT command line interface or something similar.

About mice:
To use your mouse you  have to install a  Microsoft compatible  DOS  mouse
driver.  You can force GD View to use a  slow mouse reset or to invert the
mouse buttons by editing gdv.cfg appropriately.

5. USING GD VIEW
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generally,  if you do not understand  something in this  section then just 
ask an advanced computer user.  Most advanced users  will be able to solve 
your problems in a few minutes.

There are several  ways to start GD View.  The easiest one  is probably to 
simply execute "GDV.EXE".  The title screen appears unless disabled (press 
any key to continue) and then you enter the directory viewer where you can 
select the files you want to display.

Alternatively,  you can just specify a file name on the command line,  for 
example:

 C:\GDV>GDV C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please refer  to your  DOS manual  for more  information  on file and path 
names.

For your convenience,  there are some additional batch files which make it 
easier for you to use some special features of GD View. Just run the batch 
file to begin:
You can use  CDPLAY.BAT to play audio CDs  (a drive letter can be supplied 
as a command line  parameter if more than one CD-ROM drive  is installed). 
You can use  FCH.BAT  to check files and TEST.BAT  to test files.  You can 
retrieve information about your  system by calling sysinfo.bat and you can 
look at your system's base memory by calling memview.bat.

If you often look at single files you  might want to use v.bat as an alias 
for gdv.exe because it is much quicker to simply type "v filename".

GD View  can  also call  external programs:  you can edit  files by  using 
ed.bat and execute  files by using ex.bat  but note that  GD View will use 
external programs to do so (external programs are other programs installed 
on your harddisk which do not belong to GD View).

Once you have started GD View everything is quite self-explaining. You can 
usually use the cursor keys to navigate and ESC or ALT-X to abort/exit. In 
most cases you can press F1 to see the online help.

The GD Unpacker:  The GD View package includes U.EXE. You can use setup to 
configure  GD View  to use the  GD Unpacker  (search for  applications and 
answer yes when you are asked if you want to assign the GD Unpacker to the 
extentions).  After that you can decompress  ZIP files  simply by pressing 
space  in the  GD View  directory viewer.  Note that GD Unpacker is  not a 
dearchiver so the correct dearchiving programs must be in your path if you 
want to use this feature.  You will need PKZIP (for .zip files), RAR, ARJ, 
ARC (for .arc and .ark),  LHA (for .lzh/.lzs/.lha), extar (for .tar), ZOO, 
LUE (for .lbr)  and Limit (for .lim).  All of these programs are available 
online. Make sure that  your copy of the archivers are not too old. If you 
do not have the right  dearchiver then answer no  for that particular file 
type.

Integrated  archiver support:  GD View can  display files  in some archive 
types by  automatically  extracting them.  You will need  PKUNZIP for .zip 
files, ARJ for .arj files, RAR for .rar files and gzip for .z/.gz files.

     origin/purpose:  This is an extention of the MS DOS ANSI.SYS command
                      set which is incompatible to the ANSI X3.64
                      standard. These Files contain simple music music
                      commands.
     compliance:      The music strings are *IGNORED*. Using the ANSI
                      music mode instead of the standard ANSI X3.64 mode

                      ANSI Artists use this format, too.
                      Note that the ECMA 48 standard replaces ANSI X3.64
                      now.
     compliance:      GD View supports all commands used by ANSI.SYS and
                      some of the other ANSI X3.64 commands.
                      The "-x" and "-y" parameters can be used to

                      GDV performs line wraps because many MS DOS ANSI
                      files assume that line wraps are used but according
                      to the standard wraps shouldn't be performed with
                      the cursor movement commands. Use the "-tm_nw"
                      option to disable them. GD View assumes that the
                      ANSI file was designed to be displayed with MS DOS
                      Code Page 437 as a character set.

                      this character set although Microsoft recommends
                      using code page 850. It was first used in 1981 with

     origin/purpose:  Raw IBM PC text mode screen images. The name of this
                      format may sound a bit weird but these kind of files
                      are actually used by a lot of screen drawing
                      programs. They usually call this format "Binary" or
                      "Raw".
     compliance:      It is impossible to determine the correct screen
                      width so in some cases the "-x:NN" parameter has to
                      be used (for example "-x:40" if the screen width is
                      40).

                      File Interchange Format.
     origin/purpose:  JPEG/JFIF files use a lossy compression method to
                      minimize the file size of graphical images.
                      JPEG/JFIF files are therefore very small and they
                      can be transported at relatively high speeds over
                      the Internet.
     compliance:      Only 8-bit samples are supported. Arithmetic entropy
                      coding is not supported. Lossless JPEG is not
                      supported. Nevertheless nearly all uncorrupt files
                      should work.
                      Due to memory limitations GD View for DOS will
                      however not be able to display most progressive JPEG
                      files.

                      developed by "Mr.UNIVERSUM".
     parameters:      -bft
   - ZX SPECTRUM SCREEN
     extention:       .scr
     origin/purpose:  These are raw ZX Spectrum video memory images.
     parameters:      -zxss
   - ZX SPECTRUM SNAPSHOT (SNA)
     extention:       .sna
     origin/purpose:  SNA files are used by JPP, a ZX Spectrum emulator
                      for DOS and now also by many other ZX Spectrum
                      emulators. The Snapshot files contain a complete
                      "snapshot" of the machines state. The memory and
                      registers are saved. GD View displays the contents
                      of the video memory.
     parameters:      -sna
   - ZX SPECTRUM STANDARD FONT
     extention:       .sft
     origin/purpose:  A font file format used on the ZX Spectrum. It was

7. MISCELLANEOUS QUESTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section is in a Question and Answer form (like an Internet
FAQ list).

Q: I let SETUP auto-configure my VESA modes but when I look at a
   graphic file all I see is a blank screen / I get some kind of
   "scan range" error message.
A: This usually happens when your VESA driver claims that certain
   modes are supported although they actually aren't, often because
   your monitor is unable to handle them.
   If you have got the correct software you can reconfigure your
   VESA driver or your graphic card.
   If you are an advanced computer user you can also try to edit the
   screen.cfg file in the GD View directory (note that you must
   have completed the VESA auto-configuration in SETUP in order to
   do this). Use GD View to look at the graphic file you were
   having problems with. When the blank screen or the error message
   appears press F2 to see which graphic mode was being used. Exit
   GD View and remove the line for that mode in SCREEN.CFG. Keep
   repeating the process until you are able to look at the graphic
   file.

Q: GDV does not accept file names which start with "-"!
A: That's because the dash character is used to specify parameters.
   Use ".\" before the filename, e.g. for a file called "-test.doc"
   call gdv with "GDV .\-test.doc".

Q: I want to use GDV to look at directories but when I enter something
   like "GDV A:" then GDV just displays some information about the drive!
A: Add a "." to the drive name: instead of "GDV A:" you have to
   use "GDV A:.".

Q: Reading larger directories takes extremely long!
A: You are probably running GD View without EMS or XMS. As stated in the
   system requirements section you must have some free expanded or
   extended memory. Well, anyway, GD View DOES run without it but as you
   have noticed it is really slow. In fact, systems which run without EMS
   or XMS usually do not have a disk cache so the whole process becomes
   even
   slower. You can improve the performance a lot by selecting that you
   want an unsorted file list (press CTRL-F7 in the directory viewer).
   The best thing to do is of course to install an EMS or XMS driver.

Q: I read a lot of non-English texts on my PC but some of the accented
   characters and other special characters don't appear properly when I
   look at Amiga/Windows/Mac/etc. texts!
A: You have to select the correct character set. Press ALT-C when you are
   in the text viewer and select the right one. For Amiga texts you can
   use "ISO 8859/1". If you have you have already selected the right one
   then the problem might have another reason. GD View reads your file
   properly but unfortunately it cannot display all characters because
   only characters which are in the local character set can be displayed.
   And in some cases GD View doesn't support all characters of the local
   character set.

Q: I used GD View to search for a string but GD View didn't find it
   although I could see it on the screen! What am I doing wrong?
A: GD View doesn't find strings unless they are a perfect match. The
   string which you saw on the screen probably contained some kind of
   invisible control codes (e.g. backspaces).

Q: Unicode files produced by GD View are bad!
A: Some programs, such as Windows NT's NotePad do not support the use
   of "U2028" as the newline character although that is the Unicode
   line seperator code. This is not a bug in GD View.

Q: I've got some raw graphical images? How do I display them?
A: If you are specifying the file name on the command line then just
   add "-rgi" to the command. If you are using the directory viewer
   then press Shift-F3 instead of F3 and enter "rgi". After that
   you will be prompted for the image parameters.

Q: GDV aborts and just says that a "JPEG error" occured. What is that
   supposed to mean?
A: This can have a lot of reasons. This happens, for example, when:
   - there is too little free base memory
   - there is too little free harddisk space
   - the JPEG file has an error (the file is bad)
   - the JPEG file is not JFIF compatible

Q: GDV can't play FLI files created by HCMAKE!
A: FLI files created by HCMAKE are not real FLI files. As far as I
   know HCPLAY is the only program which can play those files.

Q: Sound files seem to be "hacked up"!
A: 1. Try using a faster storage medium, for example if the files are
      on CD-ROM or floppy disks then copy them to your harddisk.
   2. If there is too little free base memory then GD View only uses
      one buffer. Free more base memory!
   3. The sample quality is too high (the higher the sample quality the
      more data has to be processed per second). Try using a sound
      program to reduce the quality of the sound file.

Q: How did you make GD View?
A: GD View is written in C++. It's not that easy to say when I started
   working on the code because I started working on GD View in this
   form in January 1996 but some of the code is based on or identical
   to code in older projects of mine (the oldest ones are from 1993).

Q: The system info routines really should display some information
   about <something>!
A: I never finished translating my old system information program from
   Pascal to C++ and I guess I never will. I don't really want to work
   on those routines any more.

Q: I have found a bug which is not mentioned in the manual! What should
   I do?
A: First of all, I already know about the following bugs:
   - sometimes when you start the cd player it seems to hang until
     you eject the cd
   - occasionally, scrolling will not work as expected with some text
     files
   - damaged/corrupted files can cause problems
   If you find other bugs then contact me and explain what happens, when
   it happens and what configuration you use (everything as detailed as
   possible). My mail addresses are in listed in section 8 of this
   manual. I will try to solve the problem but naturally I cannot promise
   anything.

9. CREDITS AND GREETINGS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The JPEG code used by GD View is based on the work of the Independent JPEG 
Group.
This product uses the SPAWNO routines by Ralf Brown to minimize memory use 
while shelling to DOS and running other programs.

A lot of  information on  character  sets was  obtained  from the  RFC1345 
document by Keld Simonsen.
Misc. information  was obtained  from the famous  interrupt list  by Ralph 
Brown.
