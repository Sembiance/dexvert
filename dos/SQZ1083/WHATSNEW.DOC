    *	Support for MOVE;

	    Add and move:

		SQZ AM archive filespec
		SQZ MA archive filespec
		SQZ A /Z4 archive filespec


	    Update and move:

		SQZ UM archive filespec
		SQZ MU archive filespec
		SQZ M archive filespec
		SQZ U /Z4 archive filespec


    *	Another type of listing.

	    SQZ LB archive filespec	-   Brief listing

		or

	    SQZ L  /z5 archive filespec


	    Modification Date	Uncompressed size   Path and filename
	    1992-02-15 12.13	.......563	    SQZ1083\TEST.TXT
	    1992-02-15	5.23	.....10233	    SQZ1083\SVEN.TXT
		2 files.	    =10796


    *	Some speed improvments over 1.08.2, particular in smaller files, eg.
	less than 30000 bytes.


    *	Fixed an error in SFX, which extracted to the root, not the current
	directory.


    *	Some text were changed.


    *	Use of Q (capital q) to gain higher speed.
	The speed, during my testing anyway, equals ARJ 2.30 for q and
	ARJ 2.39a for Q. Default are still q5 (lower case q).
	The speed improvents are higher in the lower speeds, i.e. the
	differance between q9 and Q9 are less than between Q0 and q0.

	"SQZ A /q5 ARC *.*" will compress more than "SQZ A /Q5 ARC *.*", but
	will take more time (10% to 20% more) to give some 2% better
	compression.


    *	Added support for volume label, /$
	Doesn't allow extraction of volume label.


    *	Prohibits extraction to CLOCK$/CON/AUX/COM0..9.


    *	*.* will be used if there's no file specification when issuing Add or
	Update.

    *	Assignment of work-directory.

	/W, pick work-directory from environment-variable TMP. if TMP doesn't
	exist SQZ will look for TEMP instead. If none of them exist than the
	current directory will be used.

	/w<work-directory>, work-directory should follow directly after /w.

	If there's no ending '\', then will it be added.

    *	Storeage for directory if /S used. This can be used for storing
	empty directories. Date are set to date of extraction, not creation
	of directory, but attributes are kept.

	To include directories in listings use /s or /S.


    *	# - current date.

	#Y#M#D#H  creates a archive name from the current date.


	#Y gives current year with two digits.

	#M gives current month with two digits.

	#D gives current day of month with two digits.

	#H gives current hour in 24-hour format (00 to 23).


	#M_#D_#Y creates the name, if current date are 30th october 1992,
	10_30_92.


	The use of this function might be to split all post into one archive
	for each day.


	SQZ M \PKT\OUT\PKT_#M#D     - will move all files into the archive of
				      the current date and you don't have to
				      worry where all files went.


    *	Extended the 'E' command to include embedded path information when
	extracting, if used in conjuction with /S, i.e. E + /S --> /X

SQZ - Squeeze it, version 1.08.2, release date 1992/09/13
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	What's new from 1.08.1, 1992/08/22?

	/Z3	Switch which gives a better ratio when packing text-files.
		Will perform rather poorly on C-files, but ok on TXT/DOC.


	The order of options and arcspec is now more free than it used
	to be, i.e. all below are correct and will work;


	    sqz a tcinc /sp1z01 tcinc\*.*

	    sqz a /sp1 tcinc /z01 tcinc\*.*

	    sqz a /sp1z01 tcinc tcinc\*.*


	The first parameter, excluding command, without a leading '/' or '-'
	are considered to be an archive specification.


	Support for both '/' and '-' as switchars. The one first occuring
	will be used, i.e.:


	    sqz a tcinc /sp1z01 tcinc\*.*	-   Ok, use /
						    add tcinc\*.*

	    sqz a tcinc -sp1z01 tcinc/*.*	-   Ok, use -
						    add tcinc/*.*

	    sqz a tcinc /sp1 -z01 tcinc\*.*	-   Ok, uses /
						    add -z01. and tcinc\*.*

	Yes, use of '-' as switchar forces use of '/' as directory char.



	Comments are now implemented.

	    SQZ C archive filespec

		    or

	    SQZ C archive CON		to read from stdin.
