    :param maxbonesperpartition: Maximum number of bones in each partition.
        The num_bones field will not exceed this number.
    :param maxbonespervertex: Maximum number of bones per vertex.
        The num_weights_per_vertex field will be exactly equal to this number.
    :param verbose: Ignored, and deprecated. Set pyffi's log level instead.
    :param stripify: If true, stripify the partitions, otherwise use triangles.
    :param stitchstrips: If stripify is true, then set this to true to stitch
        the strips.
    :param padbones: Enforces the numbones field to be equal to
        maxbonesperpartition. Also ensures that the bone indices are unique
        and sorted, per vertex. Raises an exception if maxbonespervertex
        is not equal to maxbonesperpartition (in that case bone indices cannot
        be unique and sorted). This options is required for Freedom Force vs.
        the 3rd Reich skin partitions.
    :param triangles: The triangles of the partition (if not specified, then
        this defaults to C{self.data.get_triangles()}.
    :param trianglepartmap: Maps each triangle to a partition index. Faces with
        different indices will never appear in the same partition. If the skin
        instance is a BSDismemberSkinInstance, then these indices are used as
        body part types, and the partitions in the BSDismemberSkinInstance are
        updated accordingly. Note that the faces are counted relative to
        L{triangles}.
    :param maximize_bone_sharing: Maximize bone sharing between partitions.
        This option is useful for Fallout 3.
    :param part_sort_order: List of body part numbers in the order in which
        they should appear, e.g. [5, 3, 6]. The first entry is counted. When
        maximize_bone_sharing is true, sorts the parts within the shared bones,
        and sorts the shared bone lists based on its first body part.
