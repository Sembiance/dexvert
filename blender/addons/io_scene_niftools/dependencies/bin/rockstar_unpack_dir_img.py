"""An unpack tool for rockstar .dir/.img files.

For example, consider the following folder layout, within the current folder::

  archive/Test.dir
  archive/Test.img
  archive/World.dir
  archive/World.img
  unpacked/

Within the current folder, call::

  C:\Python26\python.exe C:\Python26\Scripts\rockstar_pack_dir_img.py archive unpacked

The unpacked files will then reside in

  unpacked/Test/*.*
  unpacked/World/*.*

Beware that the .img format can only store files whose size is a
multiple of 2048. Files of a different size are padded with zeros.
