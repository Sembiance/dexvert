PAGE LENGTH

    This parameter helps to
determine where page breaks occur.
The conversion scans the document
looking for form feed character. If
found, a required page break is
issued. If no form feed is en-
countered within a number of lines
specified here, a soft page break
is issued.

    Enter the number of physical
lines per printed page, up to the
maximum of 99.

Default: 66 (lines per page)
