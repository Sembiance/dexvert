* Look into why these 2 files fail on dexdrone11 and dexdrone12 (may be due to latest libre office):
  [FAIL] document/openDocument/aw-9colorful.ott Disk family document does not match processed archive/zip Also, expected converter soffice but instead got sevenZip
  [FAIL] document/openDocument/cnt-04.ott Disk family document does not match processed archive/zip Also, expected converter soffice but instead got sevenZip
  Do this AFTER updating laptop/workstation to latest software versions

* Adopt program (try in win2k, otherwise probably win7): https://game-viewer.org/download.php
  Use it with plugin: https://game-viewer.org/plugin.php?id=90
  To view resources *.gfx: https://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/browse/11205/Gamer%20Collector%203:%20Action.iso/FUGA_192/data/plate-forme/Gold%20Miner%20Joe/GoldMiner.exe/%23setuppath%23/Graphics
  Then look at other formats it supports:
	https://game-viewer.org/games.php
	https://game-viewer.org/plugins.php
  I don't think it has an 'identification' capability, so I'd have to handle that on the dexvert side

* Use /mnt/compendium/DevLab/dexvert/sandbox/wip/demoleition.exe to handle 'MoleBox' packed files:
  https://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/view/10900/Erotik%20Poker.iso/DATA/erotik_poker.exe
  https://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/view/10900/Erotik%20Poker.iso/DATA/shop.exe

  https://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/view/10903/Erotische%20Spiele.iso/DATA/_fertig%20mahjongg/mpgplay.exe

* Make my own director ripper on linux that operates on the raw files directly. Would write my own code entirely, likely deno based.
  Look at macromediaDirector.js format for notes on other converters for a head start. May be able to just massage SCUMM into doing it
  After it fully extracts my current test files, then re-process items that have failed to process some macromedia director files.
  Write a script to search injestion alerts for something like 'magic archive/macromediaDirector' for example: http://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/admin/item?itemid=10456

* Add extraction suport for these older MacroMind Projector files. No known converter or extractor:
	https://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/search?qfields=name&detection=macroMindProjector
	https://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/search?qfields=name&detection=VWMD

	https://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/search?qfields=name&detection=DG06&strict=strict

* Pay someone to reverse engineer and build an extracter for the 7,600+ unique Mac Installer VISE packages: https://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?formatid=installerVISE&dedup=dedup
  http://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/browse/4161/Miami%20Dolphins%20Cheerleaders%201998.iso/mac/Install/Install%20ScreenSaver
  I started it in ~/bin/unVISEInstaller.js based on this info: https://pastebin.com/GwQYz2gG
  Also found: https://github.com/habnabit/delvmod/wiki/Installer_VISE
  Both of those links I archived in sandbox/wip/installerVISE
  But there were too many differences and I'm not the best at reverse engineering so I stopped for now.

* Could improve font handling. Have it so it must always produce either a bitmap or vector font file and then discmaster can make a thumbnail of that in injest step and maybe add a slightly more robust (showing all chars) view-font page
  Some things can't be handled this way though, such as recoil2png and imagemagic convert font handling, so this sort of change may require a bunch of reverse engineering work to properly convert old fonts into new fonts (rather than just getting preview images)

* See about adopting these tools for Filemaker Pro files: https://github.com/evanmiller/fmptools


/-----------------\
| Medium Priority |
\-----------------/
* Add OS/2 support by either using OS/2 Warp 4.5.2 (winworld) on 86Box or by using ArcaOS (was blue lion) in vbox/vmware: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utse8P_L8k0
  Then add format support for:
	archive/os2FTCOMP
	archive/iconHeaven
	image/pmDraw
	document/os2Help	(https://hobbes.nmsu.edu/?path=%2Fpub%2Fos2%2Futil%2Fconvert)

* Look at supporting Pro 24 sng's via hatari on win 7 (see notes in music/pro24SNG.js)
  Then re-process those in: https://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/browse/10762/Atari%20Forever%203.zip/Atari%20Forever%203.iso/PD_THEMA/MIDISONG/*/24_SNG/*
  Other items may also have these songs (especially the other Atari Forever cds) but would need to do some searches/checks
  These are the possible prefixes I've found, so look for these in 'detections':
	0006AAD4
	0006729A
	0008FE2C
	0007D950
	00076D20
	00078C80

* "wuimg" is sensitive, not sure why yet (run over and over: testdexvert --format=image/yanagisawaPIC2)
  Setting exclusive = "wuimg"; didn't help. May have to due with virtualX.
  I was able to reproduce it with a bash script (/mnt/compendium/DevLab/dexvert/sandbox/convertCat.sh)
  I didn't submit a bug about it because I'm not certain it's a wuimg bug vs creating multiple fake GLX contexts bug/xvfb

* image/amosPicturePacker currently is only supported by abydos and it doesn't always get it right.
  It also doesn't associated .pal palette files: https://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/2209/Assassins%203%20-%20The%20Ultimate%20Games%20CD%20(1997)(Weird%20Science)[!][Amiga-CD32-CDTV].iso/play_zone/animal_pairs/pictures
  Perhaps get deark to add support for this format.

* Found several BitRock installers on DiscMaster:http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=BitRock+Installer&qfields=content&formatid=xml
  I tried using this extractor: https://gist.github.com/mickael9/0b902da7c13207d1b86e
  But failed to get it to extract anything. See my progress and overlay ebuilds in sandbox/app/bitrock-unpacker/

* Now that Print to File/PDF works better, should now be able to support:
  document/greenstreetPublisher (Open in win2k (or winxp) with Publishing Suite 99)

* Add POVRAY rendering support (see the extensive notes in povRay.js)
  Example files: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/15720/Disk18.iso/ZIPS/POV@.EXE/POV
  Other POV files: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=pov&qfields=ext&family=text&dedup=dedup
* Add moRay support. See format moRay.js for notes

* InstallShield cab extraction can be problematic as unshield doesn't work correctly with everything.
  For example CABS from: https://archive.org/details/250TCF
  They take up 653MB of space but only 62MB is extracted.
  Possible options: https://community.flexera.com/t5/InstallShield-Knowledge-Base/Installshield-Setup-exe-Command-Line-Parameters/ta-p/4270
  Or maybe try installing Install Shield authoring itself to see if I can open them or build an extractor or something:
	https://archive.org/details/install-shield-6.2-pro-std.-7z
	https://archive.org/details/installshield1150premier

* ISOs I was unable to process:
	No idea what format this is in: https://archive.org/details/Royal_Tyrrell_Museum_Virtual_Tour_2003_WIN98
	These don't convert for some reason, they both appear to be Mac CDs
		https://archive.org/details/800_jeux_pour_mac		This one has an extra 16 bytes at front, removing it doesn't fix it, but did allow UniExtract to extract a TOAST partition, but couldn't process that at all either
		https://archive.org/details/Lex-C-RomSharewareExpress	no idea on this one
	Raw mac partition dumps:
		https://archive.org/details/apple-r-p-lib-internal-v-1.0
		https://archive.org/details/apple-r-p-lib-internal-v-2.0
		https://archive.org/details/apple-r-p-lib-reseller-v-1.0_202007

* Would be nice to convert additional UTX formats, such as textures: http://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/browse/542/EJV8_CD1.ISO/ejv8-cd1/data/shoot/Unreal%20Tournament%202003/UT%202003.exe/Textures
  The 'real' solution is probably to load up a period-appropriate UnrealEngine editor in winxp and have it import the UTX file itself and then export all the contents within
  Similar to how MacromediaDirector does it.
  Extra bonus points if I use UnrealEngine itself to create a 'tool' that can automatically open a .utx, read in all assets and convert them automatically to output files

* Add 'proper' AskSam support: https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/2024/01/26/asksam/
  Right now I just have it as a 'simple' file using strings, of which I already have some samples for

* Audio not getting extracted from some multi-track ISOs: https://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/517

* Could create a DOOM TITLEPIC converter for files like: https://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/view/223/The%20Arsenal%20Files%20Collection%20%238%20(Arsenal%20Computer)%20(1996).ISO/g_doom/a1-snp2.zip/A1-SNP2.WAD/023.TITLEPIC
  Format: https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Picture_format   (COLORMAP: https://doomwiki.org/wiki/COLORMAP)

* See about converting this Java code to javascript to extract archive/innoSetupArchive: https://github.com/d0k/ednaunpack
  Right now it wants a specific CD/DVD, but maybe it's flexible enough to handle any archive file like: setup*.bin  https://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/browse/6096/UFO_OfficeGames_DVD.iso

* With wine (or win7) I can add support for the 'sgs.dat' file from the 'Hyper Animation games (sandbox/app/DecomposeSGS)'
  There are only a handful of these files (14), so it's not a high priority


/--------------\
| Low Priority |
\--------------/
* Consider adding other detectors:
  - Try latest magika model release: https://github.com/google/magika/tree/main/assets/models/standard_v2_1
	See if I already have legacy code for it or not. Ensure it runs in CPU mode, and probably as a webserver I can send reqs to
	Then run it against all samples using my util script
	Then file bugs for misdirections 
  - Try adding puremagic 'detect' program: https://github.com/cdgriffith/puremagic
	After, run: cd util && dra checkDetector.js --program=puremagic --format=image/p   (then later, --format=all)  

* Might be fun to detect MacOS kalideoscope themes and grab the individual images and render some sort of 'preview' of it: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=%22Minimum+Kaleidoscope+version%22&qfields=content&family=text&dedup=dedup
  If I name the preview something like kalideoscope_preview_dexvert.png then I can find them more easily

* Create a Duke Nukem 3D ART extractor/convertor, see sandbox/wip/dukeART
  The BAFed jar (java -jar BAFed.jar) can load and show the ART files, with animation, but can't really export
  The 'test.py' script comes from: http://justsolve.archiveteam.org/wiki/ART_(Duke_Nukem_3D)
  That link also has a brief overview of the format.
  The test.py script claims it can extract the files, and it does extract SOME of the PNGs from: TILES005.ART
  But I could use that as the starting point for my own deno based script. It should also create animated GIFs for animated tiles
  Can convert these: http://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/browse/849/boot-disc-1996-08.iso/content/demos/games/duke3d/duke3d.grp
  http://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/browse/98/EPISODE_17_SEP_1995.iso/demos/tekw
  http://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/search?q=TILES000.ART&qfields=name
  Have dexvert match *.art extension, with auxFiles req that palette.dat exists in dir and idCheck that file starts with 0x01 00 00 00

* Improve 'fragile' formats (these are very sensitive and sometimes convert OK, sometimes don't. May be CPU load related, may be something else):
  archive/halfLifeModel					Crowbar program seems to be sensisitve
  archive/hypercard						Sometimes certain cards/bitmaps don't render
  archive/windowsResource				Converter program is sensitive, would like to find a better resource ripper, maybe even code my own
  audio/downloadableSoundBank			Sometimes not all .mp3 files are produced (shell.dls)
  document/pageMaker					The program (especially pagemaker7) may be sensitive as often it will end up converting with older converters
  font/amigaBitmapFont					Program Fony appears to be sensitive, sometimes it converts, sometimes not.
  image/harvardGraphicsChart			When running tests, I only get an output image about 50% of the time
  music/smus							Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. aboutmodern.smus is particularily sensitive

* Now that I emulate a real sound card with 86Box, I may be able to support music/famiTracker in winxp. See note

* Consider updating the b3d plugin script for blender: https://github.com/joric/io_scene_b3d/issues/11  &  https://github.com/joric/io_scene_b3d/tree/4.0

* Add all formats the Konvertor supports, warning, it's a LOT (copy-paste the list of each category from programs_formats.txt)

* Contact @Skyplayer37 on twitter to see if they are up for updating their blender code to work with blender 4.0
  Github code (backed up to sandbox/app/1993-Model-Importer): https://github.com/Skyplayer37/1993-Model-Importer
  3D files: https://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/2020/The%20640%20Meg%20Shareware%20Studio%20CD-ROM%20Volume%20II%20(Data%20Express)(1993).ISO/graphics/3d25.zip
  Original Post: https://twitter.com/Skyplayer37/status/1593440006261321729?s=20&t=ZJ4V5KTiA_rfV0YHnjJdYg

* Look at these blog posts and see about adding support for some of those formats. At the very least link to these articles from the notes field of each format:
  https://codecs.multimedia.cx/2024/04/a-quick-look-at-gold-disk-animation/
  https://codecs.multimedia.cx/2024/04/a-look-at-more-formats/
  https://codecs.multimedia.cx/2024/04/another-quick-look-at-two-amiga-formats/

* Try out these converter programs to see if they support any additional formats (temporarily test each on a VNC win2k/winxp):
  Micrografx Graphics Suite (check out Picture Publisher, Designer and Simply 3D): https://winworldpc.com/product/micrografx-graphics-suite/2
  Micrografx Draw: https://winworldpc.com/product/micrografx-draw/60

* There was a product called Macromedia Authorware (later Adobe Authorware) that could create interactive e-learning stuff
  It was also oftne used for interactive stuff on CD's, such as: https://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/4/100%20Fonts.iso/FONTMGR/Demos/PtxDemo.exe/Finaldem.exe
  It could be compiled to an .exe and supported both mac and pc.
  About 25 or so unique ones can be found on discmaster: https://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=%22Authorware+file%22&qfields=filename&qfields=ext&qfields=content&family=text&formatid=txt&dedup=dedup
  There may be more, as the search term I used may be pretty specific to the particular version 4 that the above example is from
  It would be great if the authorware content could be 'extracted' from the .exe file somehow (probably protected/compressed) and then further extracted into the original media assets

* It might be fun to write a parser for this obscure format: https://breakintochat.com/wiki/Instant_Graphics_and_Sound_(IGS)
  It's documented pretty well in sandbox/app/IGSED25.ZIP  -> MODEMS/MOD_A2L/IGSED25/IGS217.TXT
  It also does sound and music though, so maybe this is more of an archive producing both images and audio? or maybe a video?

* So meshlab (https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/meshlab) uses vcglib which has support for these 3D formats: PLY, STL, OFF, OBJ, 3DS, COLLADA, PTX, V3D, PTS, APTS, XYZ, GTS, TRI, ASC, X3D, X3DV, VRML, ALN
  Sadly the version in Gentoo as of Mar 2024 is 4 years old and attempts to compile it myself yielded a lost afternoon and lots of frustration

* Freecad (already in portage) has several formats: STEP, IGES, OBJ, STL, DXF, SVG, DAE, IFC or OFF, NASTRAN, VRML, FCStd  (from https://wiki.freecad.org/Feature_list)
  But it pulls in 40 other packages, some of them quite large including additional slotted versions of CLANG. Yuck. Pass for now.
  It also has additional addons' that support other formats from: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons

* Add DOS printing support to DOSBox with a patch from: https://sourceforge.net/p/dosbox/patches/?limit=250
  I've downloaded the patch and the required fonts.zip to sandbox/app/virtualPrinter/
  Once I have that I could support certain formats like:
	document/dartHypertext
	document/envisionPublisherDoc
	document/ibmStoryboardDocument

* So 'xv' claims to have supprt for image/yanagisawaPIC2
  I compiled the latest version from: https://github.com/jasper-software/xv   (archived copy in sandbox/app/xv.tar.gz)
  The version above has all the patches that are out there, including the jumbo patches and makes it so it builds on modern linux
  But it couldn't open any of my sample PIC2 files.
  If I were to get it to load them, I'd also have to add a command line '-convert' flag to auto convert the picture to .ppm

* Create a util/openVNCWindows.js <host> that will dynamically determine how to open all the VNC windows
  Probably update wine and os to record down in a ram dexvert file which VNC ports are being listened on
  If host is omitted or is localhost then open locally.
  If host is a remote host then use vncRemote command

* Would be nice to take this Java program and make a CLI conversion program from it's code (git cloned a copy into sandbox/app/): https://github.com/kreativekorp/powerpaint
  I submitted an issue on their GitHub asking if that would be possible, or at least some help in which classes/methods to use to make it happen
  Go through formats it supports (see programs_formats.txt) and try them out against dexvert test cases and consider adding to dexvert

* This program is able to identify, extract and convert hundreds of visual novel file formats: https://github.com/morkt/GARbro
  It's written in C# .net but targets an old version 4.6. It also references several DLLs that they don't provide.
  The author has said that they are proprietary and he doesn't care that it won't compile anyhere else. The main build is years old.
  There is no working Console support, but there is a pull request that tries to fix that: https://github.com/morkt/GARbro/pull/394/commits   (https://github.com/Bioruebe/GARbro/tree/2112bde1cc13eb817b8d541c3bcc7a68c4f71883)
  I've saved the full source code (as of Feb 2024) WITH the pull request merged to: sandbox/app/GARbro.tar.bz2
  With compilation not being an option and the build being so old (it didn't work right under wine anyways, I tried) just the code is useful
  What needs to happen is I need to examine the code closely, see how it 'detects' formats, 'extracts' and 'converts'
  Then I need to make a new .net mono project and slowly bring over the code, 1 file at a time, writing new API stub backings as needed
  That's a TON of work. So while it would be awesome to detect these formats and handle them, it's on the back burner for a while
  If I do do it, get 'detection' working first as another 'detect' program. Then get extraction and use these samples:
	test/sample/unsupported/visualNovel/
	test/sample/archive/fat12/*/*
  	https://archive.org/details/pc-98_20230120

* See if I can detect and extract the compressed files in sandbox/fail/unsupportedCompression/*
  Maybe something from: https://www.sac.sk/files.php?d=7&l=

* Add OS X support, running under something like vbox/vmware.
  Then add programs:
	Graphic Converter (https://www.lemkesoft.de/en/products/graphicconverter/key-features/import-and-export-formats
	First test on my real mac to see if I can convert files via CLI (check PCX, AOL Art, etc) (see Help->CLI Commands)
	If CLI works then try getting it working in a virtual machine of some sort, something more portable than QEMU
	To run the supervisor.sh script on boot: https://www.karltarvas.com/2020/09/11/macos-run-script-on-startup.html
  Add format support:
	archive/sparseImage

* Add Classic MacOS support, probably use this software: https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/oneclick
  Probably spin up fresh mac instances each time with a custom HD image with the script and in/out folders pre-prepared
  After it's working, I can then support 'Graphic Converter' and these formats:
	These seem to be Disk Copy 5/6, which I may be able to extract/convert with: http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/disk-copy-6
	  https://archive.org/details/GigaROM2.0.img
	  https://archive.org/details/InfoMac5Disk1.img
	  https://archive.org/details/InfoMac5Disk2.img
	  http://dev.discmaster2.textfiles.com/view/5525/Apple%20Media%20Image%20Disc%20Vol.%205.smi.bin

* Add RISC OS support, with one of these emulators:
	https://www.marutan.net/rpcemu/index.php
	http://arcem.sourceforge.net/
	http://b-em.bbcmicro.com/arculator/
	http://www.virtualacorn.co.uk/product.htm  (only runs on Windows)
	http://www.riscos.com/shop/products/106/index.htm  
  Will want to find CineWorks application and probably stick to version 3.x of RiscOS: https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/5/topics/248?page=2
  Then add support for:
	unsupported/audio/audioWorksSoundSample
	video/acornReplayVideo
  More samples from:
	https://archive.org/details/cine-clips
	https://archive.org/details/acorn_replay_collection
	https://archive.org/details/cdrom-riscos-clipart
	https://archive.org/details/cdrom-riscos-risc-disc-1

* Add Old 32bit Linux support then add (see notes for each format):
  music/beRoTracker
  music/synderSNG

* Create dexvert.com with a 'Browse' button that allows you to upload files to convert.
  Bonus points if I make a quick dirty 'dexvert.sh' bash script that folks can use that will convert via wget from CLI via dexvert.com
  WARNING! I need to assume that it will be exploited since I run so many programs, many of which likely have exploits.
  So I will want to research how to run programs within some sort of jailbreak, or leverage the docker image with multiple instances

* Add rendering of previews of full game maps supported by 'gamemap': https://github.com/Malvineous/libgamemaps
  Research them here: https://moddingwiki.shikadi.net

* Could incorporate a new detectory, the DOS based identification program sandbox/app/idar215.exe (self extractor) http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/IDArc
  Due to the overhead with DOSBox, would want to use 'dosemu2' to run this directrly from the linux console: https://github.com/dosemu2/dosemu2
  I got it to install and compile, but the freedos (fdpp) linking wasn't correct yet and it failed to run IDARCH.EXE

* There are several 'detected' installer 'magic' in the 'exe.js' format, I could look into each of these and write extractors for them

* xbox content can be better extracted with: https://github.com/multimediamike/xbfuse

/----------------\
| Probably Never |
\----------------/
* https://github.com/32bitkid/sci.js/tree/main/apps/scibud
  Utilize this to convert/extract SCI0 pics from Sierra SCI files.
  The author said this about detection: the most simplistic heuristic for SCI games would be the existence of a RESOURCE.MAP file with one or more files "pack", like RESOURCE.001. There are other checks/fingerprinting to use to be more specific, but that's usually a pretty good sign that it's an SCI game.
  However, due to the fact that 99% of the CD's are actually just the installers and they are often split across files, I wasn't able to get the script to work well, as it's designed to work on the files after they've been installed, requiring things like RESOURCE.MAP and RESOURCE.001, etc. supporting files

* Use a doom2vrml program to make doom levels browseable: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/6095/WIN95_09962.iso/vrml/dm2v-10.zip  or  http://www.ocnus.com/doom.html
  I tried DM2VRML.EXE a little bit, it crashes a lot. Also, I had trouble locating Doom 1 WADs, but found lots of DOOM 2 wads.

* Add this detection program: https://github.com/google/magika
  It only detects a small handful of file formats, more modern ones too.
  For that one, I'll need to spin up a server in dexvert that runs in the background as python and responses to web requests
  Make sure I also put it on info.txt App Updates section

* Pay someone to add more formats to FFMPEG (gl/dl/ANIM/etc) or to improve existing formats: http://www.ffmpeg.org/consulting.html

* Consider switching away from DOSBOX and use an authentic MS-DOS installation under 86Box
   Pro: Compatability with some dexvert/dos/* programs that didn't work under dosbox (of which I don't know of any). Feels cleaner.
  Cons: Would need to solve video recording & keyboard control (both of which I wrote custom code patches to DOSBOX to implement)
  I could maybe add similar code to 86Box, but that would be harder to control from 'within' dos.
  It's probably not worth doing since I can't think of many 'benefits' and what I have with DOSBox "works ok"

* Add 3DO support. Ideally via mount using dexvert/sandbox/app/operafs but I'd need to update that code to compile against modern linux kernel
  Other 3DO extractor programs: https://forum.uqm.stack.nl/index.php?topic=3535.0
