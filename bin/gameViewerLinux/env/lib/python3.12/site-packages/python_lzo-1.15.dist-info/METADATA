This module provides Python bindings for the LZO data compression library.

LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
It offers pretty fast compression and *very* fast decompression.
Decompression requires no memory.

In addition there are slower compression levels achieving a quite
competitive compression ratio while still decompressing at
this very high speed.
