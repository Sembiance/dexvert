		// OK.... so file does have the --keep-going flag but it isn't really designed to properly output multiple matches as several matches also output a 'continuation' of the match on a new line
		// We do some hacky trickery here to try and determine where one match ends and another begins, but it's not great. It mostly relies on there being a comma whenever a match 'continues'
		// This sort of wonky output formatting is in libmagic itself, so writing a custom file program to directly call into libmagic.so doesn't gain us anything
		// Without --raw then file has a BUG that outputs truncated data when it encounters certain characters like \r\n See: sample/text/txt/DORINFO1.DEF
		// The file source code itself is VERY messy and gross, so trying to modify/patch it to output a better seperator when --keep-going (MAGIC_CONTINUE) is used would be painful, I couldn't figure out where it's even happening at exactly
		// So in the end we just do our best here, knowing that we'll get some grossness in the detections for some files, but hopefully this will improve with time as I discover more edge cases. Sigh.
		// Other problematic files to use to test logic:
		//     archive/rawPartition/Madame X Game.bin
		//     archive/iso/The Girls of GLITZ.iso
		//     text/txt/2.emlx
		//	   archive/zip/neopnt21.zip		<-- This shows how bad file is. The '-  to extract' line is a continuation of the previous match, but the '-  Zip archive data' is a new match. We just can't really handle this, checking case of first letter is unsafe
		//     document/dBaseMultipleIndex/CLIENT.MDX
