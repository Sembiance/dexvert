  SPUT PHONEME DEFINITIONS
  ------------------------

   Phoneme strings always start with the tilde character (~) followed by each
   of the phonemes separated by dashes.  A space or any control character
   ends the word.  (eg.  ~v-ey-p-er is the word VAPOR)
   SPUT phonemes are not case sensitive, and are compatible with TRAN phonemes.

   SmoothTalker phonemes are supported so that any files that already contain
   SmoothTalker phonemes will be interpreted correctly by SPUT.
  
   Many of the SmoothTalker phonemes have the same name as the SPUT
   phonemes, but those marked with an asterisk (*) are differrent.
   To create a SmoothTalker phoneme string, start the word with 2 less than
   signs, followed by the tilde character, then the string of phonemes,
   followed by 2 greater than signs to end the word. (eg. <<~vEYpER>> )
   SmoothTalker phonemes are case sensitive.

   SPUT PHONEME FUNCTIONS
   ----------------------

   The special phoneme-functions may be used at the > prompt, in a text file
   or in the exception dictionary.  The changes caused by a phoneme-function
   remain in effect until another matching phoneme-function is processed.

   They may appear alone as in the following example:
        ~A2 loud ~A3 louder ~A3 even louder ~A0 back to normal
   or as part of a phoneme string as in this example:
        ~F-AE-N-A3+-T-AE-S-A0-T-IH-K.


   An+/-   amplitude change   (n or n+ increase / n- decrease / 0 normal)

        ~A1+ or ~A1 increases the volume 1 step.
        ~A1- decreases the volume 1 step.
        ~A0 sets the volume back to normal.

        Example:  At the > prompt type "this is ~a3 louder"
                  or "this is ~a3- softer"
                  or "this is loudly"  (this line will play louder)
                                     (because it's in the dictionary)
                  or type "SPUT .\PHFUNA.TXT" to hear more samples.
                

   Rn+/-   rate change  (n new-rate / n+ increase / n- decrease/ 0 normal)

        ~R10+ increases the rate by 10 (relative to current rate)
        ~R10- decreases the rate by 10 (relative to current rate)
        ~R202 sets the rate to 202 (absolute setting)
        ~R0 set the rate back to normal.

        Example:  At the > prompt type "this is ~r10+ faster"
                  or "this is ~r10- slower"
                  or type "SPUT .\SAMPLES.TXT" for more samples.

   Mn   mode  (0=word(default) 1=letter)        

   Pn   punctuation level  (0=none 1=some(default) 2=most 3=all)
        0  pronounces no punctuation
        1  pronounces # $ % & = @ + < > ! /
                      and . (point) if followed by a character
        2  pronounces all level 1 punctuation and
                      " ' ( ) * , - : ; ? [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~
                      and . (period)                   
        3  pronounces all level 1+2 punctuation
                      and all control characters (not yet implemented)
