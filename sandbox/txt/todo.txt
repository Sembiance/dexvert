* InstallShield cab extraction can be problematic as unshield doesn't work correctly with everything. For example: This doesn't extract right: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/2673/250_TCF.iso
Try these params: https://community.flexera.com/t5/InstallShield-Knowledge-Base/Installshield-Setup-exe-Command-Line-Parameters/ta-p/4270
Also try loading up installshield itself and see if I can open them or something:

* Add support for VRML. Possible renderers: https://github.com/castle-engine/view3dscene, Blender, Blaxxun Contact 4.4
  Would love have it be interactive in the browser. See the 3D/Poly support note below:
* Add 3D/Poly support. Can convert everything to GLTF/GLB format and use this viewer on the website: https://modelviewer.dev/
  Or use X3D instead?  https://cadexchanger.com/blog/3d-formats-overview-vrml-and-x3d/
  3DS is 3DS Max, so use that to convert things like: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/1268/Graphics%20Plus.iso/media/objects/3ds/ve_space/romulan.zip
  Software to convert DXF (and others) to GLB: https://github.com/assimp/assimp
  Other software that works with GLB: https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Project-Explorer/
  https://castle-engine.io/view3dscene.php
  Converting Shockwave 3D files: https://github.com/tomysshadow/Shockwave-3D-World-Converter
  https://cadexchanger.com/contact-us/licensing-inquiry/#requestFormSection
* Would be great if on the 'browse' page each model could be viewed inline in a small thumbnail sized interactive viewer. Though this may be too intensive? Maybe generate thumbs for each one, as we do for images and show the thumbs instead
  For a Before/After screenshot, can use search results: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=3dmf&itemid=9374
* Then use this doom2vrml program to make doom levels browseable: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/6095/WIN95_09962.iso/vrml/dm2v-10.zip
  Then reply to tweet: https://twitter.com/senn_twt/status/1591342713739288576?s=12&t=Y840vTjzTkojj8W_7FWPNw

* Once debby adds a way to leverage SCUMMVM to extract Director 3 files: https://discord.com/channels/350407629849493504/1033065501984817252/1038538531905208340
  Then process some of those files.

* Add this as an additional decrypter for Macromedia shockwave files, potentially as the first decrypter: https://github.com/ProjectorRays/ProjectorRays

* Get AARU support working: https://github.com/aaru-dps/Aaru
  http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/4313/Disc%20Dump/CD32_11.aaruf
  http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/4314/Disc%20Dump/CD32Gamer9.dicf
  Then add that converter as an option to all formats that it supports

* See about installing Director 5 under WINDOWS 2000 and see if I can open Director 5 files: https://winworldpc.com/product/director/50
  https://discord.com/channels/350407629849493504/1033065501984817252/1041666797247664139
  Also see if I can do some of the director 3 mac files? https://discord.com/channels/350407629849493504/1033065501984817252/1038536366818086963

* See if I could handle extraction of TEXT data better from certain director files:
  http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/4274/CD-Rom%20now%20n.21.iso/director/stones.dir/00025_Field_25.txt
  If I improve it, reply here: https://discord.com/channels/350407629849493504/1033065501984817252/1044841211090960424

* Once recoil has PIC2 support, enable it in src/format/image/yanagisawaPIC2.js  and then reprocess:
  http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=.p2&qfields=ext&itemid=6354&itemid=6355&itemid=6356&itemid=6357&itemid=6358&label=&labelMatchType=any&sizeMin=&sizeMax=&durationMin=&durationMax=&widthMin=&heightMin=&widthMax=&heightMax=&tsMin=&tsMax=&nsfw=2&nsfwOnly=0&animated=&sortBy=_text_match&limit=100

* Get the IFF-RGFX datatype installed and working on my Amiga:http://aminet.net/package/util/dtype/RGFX-DT or http://aminet.net/package/util/dtype/RGFX-DT35
  Once it can view pictures, see about how I can convert into PNG, maybe with: https://aminet.net/package/gfx/conv/gfxcon
  Also see if I can add IFF YAFA support
  If either of the above fails, then add to Low Priorty: Code my own image converter for IFF RGFX and IFF YAFA that leverages ancient to do unpacking of the data. See deark issues for more details.

* Find a converter/decompiler for applesoft BASIC. Maybe I can use: https://github.com/AppleCommander/AppleCommander/search?q=Applesoft

* Add OS/2 support by using ArcaOS (was blue lion) in QEMU: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utse8P_L8k0
  Then add format support for:
	archive/os2FTCOMP
	archive/os2InstallPackage
	archive/iconHeaven
	image/pmDraw
	document/os2Help	(https://hobbes.nmsu.edu/?path=%2Fpub%2Fos2%2Futil%2Fconvert)
	and others (see unsupported notes). Then re-process any CD's that have those formats on them (#570, etc)

* Create a deno based parser that can parse internet e-mail/news formats to verify that they are indeed valid files. Bonus points for converting HTML based emails into .html documents
  http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Internet_e-mail_message_format
  See samples in: sandbox/samples/mail_news/

* If deark adds better IFF IMAG support, re-process: 265 301 313 356 357 406 481 510 517 518 519 520 607 614 615 629 731 732 766 790 921 969
  Ideally this search should return 321+ matches:
  http://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=&qfields=content&qfields=filename&qfields=ext&formatid=cdiIFFImage&labelMatchType=any&label=&sizeMin=&sizeMax=&durationMin=&durationMax=&widthMin=&heightMin=&widthMax=&heightMax=&tsMin=&tsMax=&nsfw=2&animated=&sortBy=_text_match&limit=100&nocache=true

* Once I can find later versions of Asymetrix Toolbook (aka Multimedia ToolBook), use it to extract files from .tbk files
  Note, quite possibly will need a seperate version for every possible versioned TBK file.
  I tried ToolBook 3.0 (from winworld) on a photos.tbk and it said it needed a later version.
  The only other copy I could find is on eBay, version 4.0 which I ordered is and is coming

* Add RiscOS support. QEMU doesn't currently support it enough to get RISC OS to even boot. Instead use either:
	https://www.marutan.net/rpcemu/index.php
	http://arcem.sourceforge.net/
	http://b-em.bbcmicro.com/arculator/
	http://www.virtualacorn.co.uk/product.htm  (only runs on Windows)
 http://www.riscos.com/shop/products/106/index.htm  
	Reprocess:
	  Acorn Replay videos (#625 CineClips) http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/625
	  ArtWorks ClipArt 1
  	Will want to find CineWorks application and probably stick to version 3.x of RiscOS: https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/5/topics/248?page=2
	also:
	  (unsupported/audio/audioWorksSoundSample)
	After added, register rated 4 items: Archive Magazine, Archimedes *, ARM Club, APDL*, Archimedes, RISCafe

* Add image converter support (oiiotool/iconvert) for all formats supprted by: https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio

* Add all formats supported by: http://www.seasip.info/Unix/LibDsk/index.html
  Could convert a known RAW diskImage format into another and then use that to help dexid
* 
Add support for this 3D format: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/2020/The%20640%20Meg%20Shareware%20Studio%20CD-ROM%20Volume%20II%20(Data%20Exo)(1993).ISO/graphics/3d25.zip
  Using blender with a plugin: https://github.com/Skyplayer37/1993-Model-Importer/blob/main/1993-3D.py
  From twitter user: https://twitter.com/Skyplayer37/status/1593440006261321729?s=20&t=ZJ4V5KTiA_rfV0YHnjJdYg

* Add support for The Print Shop Deluxe Graphics library:
  http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/4974/Handwritten%20Fonts.iso/previews/famousmg/famousmg.psg
  http://discmaster.textfiles.com/view/4974/Handwritten%20Fonts.iso/previews/artparts/apsamplr.psg

* Create an extractor for the embedded images and audio within a Microsoft Agent Character (other/microsoftAgentCharacter)
  Full file format details available in sandbox/wip/MSAgentDataSpecification_v1_4.htm
  Bonus points if I actually animate the character in a couple poses/animations into an animated GIF/movie

* Consider updating IsoBuster to 5.0 (or later if new version available) (WARNING! BACKUP hd.img FIRST, just in case this doesn't work out!): https://www.isobuster.com/news/isobuster_4.9_release_notes
  NOTE: This is a paid upgrade (see email for link with a 30% discount, which may now be expired)

* Japanese visual novels have a variety of archive formats, many supported by this program: https://github.com/morkt/GARbro
  Sadly that program required .NET 4.6 or later, which doesn't work in Windows XP, so I'd need to use a vistaSP2 image: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/get-started/system-requirements
  If I do go down this route, I can re-process: http://discmaster.textfiles.com/browse/1123
  Someone else mentioned on github that it works with wine-mono

* The program 'Master Tracks Pro' (to support music/masterTracksPro of which I forgot to add sample files) only works in Vista or later.
  I could create another VMWare image with Vista and use it to run it, but seems like overkill for just 1 program for 1 format.
  If I choose to do this, the app is in sandbox/app/master_tracks_pro_full.exe and S/N is in email.

* GoADF 4.0 will add support for mounting an ADF file via an arexx port. Add this to adfOFS and adfFFS when added: http://www.bitplan.pl/goadf/download.html

* Add 3DO support. Ideally via mount using dexvert/sandbox/app/operafs but I'd need to update that code to compile against modern linux kernel
  Other 3Do extractor programs: https://forum.uqm.stack.nl/index.php?topic=3535.0
  Some additional OperaFS programs: http://altmer.arts-union.ru/3DO/3do_utils.htm

* Figure out why this "eats" my input: test/testdexvert.js --format=music/sid

* If I've made my Deno TUI lib, re-code dexbrute to use it

* Add sparseimage conversion support (requires MacOS X qemu, see archive/sparseImage notes)

* Add better hypercard support. Right now stackimport segfaults on almost every stack and only extracts some of the files
  Write my own deno based extractor based on the format specs: https://github.com/PierreLorenzi/HyperCardPreview/blob/master/StackFormat.md
  Reference of course stackimport and HyperCardPreview code as needed to see how to handle any particular conversion

* document/wildcatWCX files often fails to convert when running tests, try and reproduce so I can figure out why

* Could add printer support to DOSBox: https://sourceforge.net/p/dosbox/patches/?limit=250
  Then I could 'print' certain things, like EnvisionPublisher documents (look for others)

* Improve ILBM animations. Probably need to use an amiga program under QEMU and export as either GIF or raw PNG frames
  Abydos author mentioned he would like to improve the animations
  PPaint can save as animated GIF, but dunno if it handles color cycling: http://www.ppaint.com/
  Maybe also check out Delxue Paint itself to see if it has any export capability: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluxe_Paint

* Support ANSI Music files: http://artscene.textfiles.com/ansimusic/

* Add support for iffCTLG. Looks pretty easy to reverse engineer.
  Use this tool, looks fun to use: http://kaitai.io/  (or just use 010 Editor templates, see dexvert/010_templates/)
  As that tool looks like I can take the result and use it directly within dexvert. Woot.
  For inspiration help: http://formats.kaitai.io/riff/index.html

* Softdisk GS Apple 2GS files have Icon files that have embedded icons. This program can view them: https://github.com/dmolony/DiskBrowser/blob/master/src/com/bytezone/diskbrowser/applefile/IconFile.java
  Doesn't look too complicated a format, could potentially convert the icons or maybe could get deark to add support for them

* Add Graphic Converter (https://www.lemkesoft.de/en/products/graphicconverter/key-features/import-and-export-formats) to my Mac Mini OSX and test CLI to convert PCX (see Help->CLI Commands)
  If that works, for QEMU OSX: https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM or https://github.com/foxlet/macOS-Simple-KVM or https://www.emaculation.com/doku.php/ppc-osx-on-qemu-for-windows
  For the OpenBoo.sh script, just reference that and run my own command line script. See the qemu.txt doc for a link to update CLI args
  To run the supervisor.sh script on boot: https://www.karltarvas.com/2020/09/11/macos-run-script-on-startup.html

* Get other formats reverse engineered. STARTED: https://telparia.com/fileFormatBounties.html
  Goal: Produce open source code (any language) that can run on Linux that can take an input file and produce one or more output PNG files
  Could also try posting on reddit r/ReverseEngineering/ or r/INAT
  Maybe offer a $5,000 bounty on one of the sites linked: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_bounty
  Alternatively I can post on reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering  also ask where else I might post such an offer

* Ask on IRC OFTC #kernelnewbies and ##linux on freenode about PAYING someone to add support to linux kernel for mounting CDI images:
  https://www.isobuster.com/help/cd-i_and_vcd
  https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Green+Book+CD-ROM
  https://www.lscdweb.com/data/downloadables/2/8/cdi_may94_r2.pdf
  See smoe tools in sandbox/app/CD-i Image Decoding Tools rhdn.zip

* Create dexvert.com with a 'Browse' button that allows you to upload files including a REST API
  WARNING! I need to assumed that it will be exploited. So I will want to run dexvert on virtual machines. Not sure if I can run virtual machines like windows from WITHIN a virtual machine running gentoo+dexvert.... hrm...


/----------------\
| Probably Never |
\----------------/
* Create native C nodejs module for imagemagick/recoil and other libs (abydos, etc) for speed. Example existing image magick one: https://github.com/elad/node-imagemagick-native

* Create a 'dexvert-remote' NPM  package that will provide the same 'dexvert inputFilePath outputDirPath' command line tool but it will upload the file to the website and then download the results all seamlessly (with progress bar)

* Convert bitmap fonts to more usable vector fonts by trying to "autotrace" the fonts, or utilize a pro tool like: https://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/bitfonter/   or   https://www.fontlab.com/font-converter/transtype/
