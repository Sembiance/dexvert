MINIMUM RIGHT MARGIN

    This parameter can be used to
tell the conversion process what
the minimum right margin generated
by the conversion should be.  This
can be very useful in keeping the
conversion from generating word
wrapped text on short lines.  The
conversion will never generate a
right margin (offset including left
margin) greater than this value.

Default: 40
